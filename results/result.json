This allocation of Assessments is\nundertaken in an effort to fairly allocate the Operating Expenses anticipated upon completion of\nPalmero.\nEach Lot Ready for Construction, Completed Lot and Incomplete Lot shall be assessed\nits pro rata portion of the total anticipated Operating Expenses, which shall be the \"Individual\nLot Assessment\" as to each Lot. The Individual Lot Assessment shall be based upon the level of\nservice to each Lot and upon the state of the Lot's development, with the Owners of Lots Ready\nfor Construction and Completed Lots paying the Operating Expenses on a twenty to one ratio\n(20:1) compared to the Owners of Incomplete Lots as set forth below. Therefore, the Builders\nowning Lots Ready for Construction, Completed Lot Owners and Incomplete Lot Owners shall\nshare the payment of the Operating Expenses on a ratio of twenty to one (20:1). Therefore, the\ntotal anticipated Operating Expenses (other than those expenses which are properly the subject of\nSpecial Assessment) shall be divided by the total number of Lots Ready for Construction and\nCompleted Lots multiplied by twenty (20) plus the number of Incomplete Lots, with the quotient\nthus arrived at being the \"Individual Lot Assessment\" for an Incomplete Lot. Said quotient\nmultiplied by twenty (20) shall be the Individual Lot Assessment for a Lot Ready for\nConstruction and a Completed Lot. The number of Lots Ready for Construction Completed Lots\nand Incomplete Lots shall be adjusted quarterly, as needed, as hereinafter set forth. At such time\nas Declarant has conveyed all of the Homes on all of the Lots, each Lot shall be a Completed Lot\nand the Individual Lot Assessment shall be equal for each Lot. Notwithstanding anything in the\nGoverning Documents to the contrary, any Assessment for Legal Fees incurred by the\nAssociation for lawsuits shall be deemed an Operating Expense which is properly the subject of\nSpecial Assessment and not the subject of an Individual Lot Assessment so long as approved\n28\n40756179.8"},{"Page":35,"Path":"C:\\Users\\timh\\Downloads\\palmero hoa\\images\\1715706741534-12de007b-8e48-45f5-8966-b3792bfd54d7_35.jpg","Read":"pursuant to Section 12 of Article XV, except the Legal Fees incurred by the Association in\nconnection with the collection of assessments or other charges which Owners are obligated to\npay pursuant to the Governing Documents or the enforcement of the use and occupancy\nrestrictions contained in the Governing Documents.\nSection 2.\nASSESSMENT PAYMENTS.

DESCRIPTION OF PALMERO
Section 1.
GENERAL PLAN OF DEVELOPMENT, Palmero comprises the Property
encompassing, or which will encompass, Lots, Homes and the Common Area as more
particularly defined by this Declaration. Palmero may be expanded to include lands which
Declarant may add, but shall in no way be obligated to add, by one or more Supplemental
Declaration(s). The Property initially declared hereunder is described in Exhibit "A" attached
hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Declarant reserves the right to modify its plan
of development of Palmero (including, without limitation, the right to modify the site plan of
Palmero and the right to change the recreational facilities, amenities, Home product types and the
number of Homes to be constructed within Palmero) and/or the right to add land to Palmero or to
withdraw land from Palmero in its sole and absolute discretion. Therefore, in the event
7
40756179.8

Declarant modifies its plan of development of Palmero, adds land to Palmero and/or withdraws
land from Palmero, the number of Lots, the layout of Lots and/or the size of Lots within Palmero
may change and as a result of any changes in the number of Lots, the Assessments required to be
paid pursuant to this Declaration may increase or decrease as appropriate. Declarant's general
plan of development further contemplates that such Homes shall be whatever types of structures
Declarant may choose which are in conformance with this Declaration. Declarant's general plan
of development of Palmero may also include whatever facilities and amenities Declarant
considers in its sole judgment to be appropriate to Palmero, as well as any changes thereto.
Additional Property will become a part of Palmero if, and only if, Declarant in its sole
discretion adds Additional Property to Palmero by recording a Supplemental Declaration to such
effect. Declarant hereby reserves an easement for ingress and egress and for utilities and
drainage over, under and across the Property for the benefit of any Additional Property;
provided, however, no such easement may be granted upon any portion of the Property that lies
directly beneath a Home.
Declarant expressly reserves the right as to the Property to (i) commence construction
and development of the Property if and when Declarant desires; (ii) develop the Property upon
such timetable as Declarant, in its sole discretion, chooses; and (iii) modify the plan of
development of the Property (including, without limitation, the right to modify the site plan
and/or master plan of Palmero, the right to add recreational facilities and amenities, and the right
to change the Home product types and number of Homes to be constructed within Palmero) in
such manner as Declarant, in its sole discretion, chooses. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as obligating Declarant to construct Palmero according to the present plan of
development or as obligating Declarant to declare any Additional Property to be Property.

Center shall be maintained, administered, operated and ultimately owned by the Association.
Declarant reserves the right, but shall not be obligated, to construct additional
recreational facilities upon the Amenity Center, and to modify or reduce the facilities and
amenities planned for the Amenity Center. Declarant, at its sole discretion, hereby expressly
reserves the right to reduce and/or modify the planned facilities, and to determine the timing of
construction of the recreational facilities and installation of amenities. The decision as to
whether to construct additional recreational facilities or amenities, to modify the planned
facilities or amenities, to reduce the planned facilities, and/or the timing of the construction
thereof, shall be in the sole discretion of Declarant.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein, neither Declarant nor the Association makes
any representations whatsoever to commence, complete or construct any of the recreational
facilities within any specific time period.
Declarant, its successors and/or assigns, shall have access to the Amenity Center at all
times during the Development and Sale Period and the Association shall not impede any such
access, and no Owner nor the Association shall do any act which may interfere with Declarant

At the time of conveyance of the Common Area or any portion thereof, the Association
shall be required to accept the Common Area, together with the personal property and
Improvements appurtenant thereto, if any. The Association hereby agrees to accept the Common
Area and the personal property and Improvements appurtenant thereto in "AS IS" "WHERE IS"
condition, without any representation or warranty, expressed or implied, in fact or by law, as to
the condition or fitness of the Common Area or any portions thereof, and the personal property
and Improvements appurtenant thereto being conveyed. IN THAT REGARD, THE
ASSOCIATION AND EACH OWNER KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY
RELINQUISHES AND WAIVES, AND DECLARANT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY
AND ALL WARRANTIES (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) AS TO THE COMMON AREA AND
16
40756179.8

PERSONAL PROPERTY AND IMPROVEMENTS WHETHER ARISING FROM CUSTOM,
USAGE OR TRADE, COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, CASE LAW OR
OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
HABITABILITY, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR ANY INTENDED OR PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
TO THE EXTENT THAT BY LAW OR OTHERWISE ANY OF THE WARRANTIES
RELINQUISHED, WAIVED OR DISCLAIMED CANNOT BE RELINQUISHED, WAIVED
OR DISCLAIMED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, ALL SECONDARY, INCIDENTAL AND
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED AND DISCLAIMED
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES RESULTING FROM CLAIMS OF
PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOSS OF USE, PERSONAL INJURY OR EMOTIONAL
DISTRESS). Without limitation, the Association shall accept all Roadways, bridges and
sidewalks, including, without limitation, all gutters, curbs and paver bricks located within and
adjacent to the Roadways and sidewalks, all as installed by Declarant, provided such Roadways,
bridges, sidewalks, gutters, curbs and paver bricks perform their intended purposes. The
Association and all Owners hereby further acknowledge and agree that small cracks in the
Roadways, bridges, sidewalks, gutters, curbs and paver bricks as well as the ponding or
collection of water following periods of rain thereon are normal and shall not be considered to be
defects or deficiencies of any kind whatsoever.
The Association and each Owner acknowledges and agrees that Declarant has or will
install trees, shrubs, plants and other landscaping that meets or exceeds the requirements of the
County Land Development Code ("LDC") and that from the time of such initial installation, such
trees, shrubs, plants and other landscaping may mature, expand, decay and/or die from time to
time. After the Turnover Date, the Association shall have no claim whatsoever against Declarant
and hereby releases any and all claims against Declarant for any trees, shrubs, plants, sod, grass
and other landscaping that has decayed or died regardless of the reasons therefor so long as all of
the remaining trees, shrubs, plants, sod, grass and other landscaping, when looked at as a whole,
exceed the minimum requirements of the LDC.
The Association and each Owner acknowledge and agree that Declarant has or will install
an irrigation system(s) for the Common Area and that the Association shall accept the
conveyance of such irrigation system(s) from Declarant in their "as-is" condition. Due to
watering restrictions instituted by the Water Management District, Declarant cannot guarantee
that the irrigation system(s) pumps will be able to provide adequate water or pressure at all times
for the Common Area. After the Turnover Date, the Association shall have no claim whatsoever
against Declarant and hereby releases any and all claims against Declarant for any lack of water
pressure or adequate water supply regardless of the reasons therefor.
The Association and each Owner acknowledge and agree that Declarant has or will install
the Surface Water Management System and that the Association shall accept the conveyance of
such Surface Water Management System from Declarant in its "as-is" condition. Declarant
cannot guarantee that the Surface Water Management System will be able to provide adequate
drainage during periods of heavy rain and therefore temporary ponding may occur. After the
Turnover Date, the Association shall have no claim whatsoever against Declarant and hereby
releases any and all claims against Declarant for any temporary ponding that may occur.
17
40756179.8

The Association shall accept this conveyance of the Common Area (together with the
personal property and Improvements appurtenant thereto) and shall pay all costs of such
conveyance including documentary stamps and other taxes of conveyance and recording charges.
The conveyance shall not, however, impair in any way Declarant's rights and easements as set
forth in this Declaration.
Commencing upon the date this Declaration is recorded, and notwithstanding that title
thereto has not yet been conveyed to the Association, the Association shall be responsible for the
maintenance of the Common Area in a continuous and satisfactory manner without cost to the

drainage easement located within a Lot upon which any such driveway and/or sidewalk or
irrigation system encroaches, the Association has the obligation, at its own cost and expense, to
remove and replace any such encroachment, and to return it to its condition immediately
preceding such removal and replacement once access to the drainage easement is no longer
required. The flowage easements providing for drainage run between each of the Lots parallel to

located beneath or within the Building shall be shared equally by each of the Owners in the
Building affected; provided, however, that where the necessary access by authorized personnel
of the utility or service company is required because of the intentional or negligent misuse of the
utility or service company line or system by an Owner, their lessee, licensee, invitee, or agent,
any expense arising therefrom shall be borne solely by such Owner. Any expense caused by the
necessary access of authorized personnel of the utility or service company to service lines

is delinquent in the payment of its monetary obligations and the tenant may deduct such amounts
paid to the Association from the rent due to the Owner. The Association has the right to require
Owners to use a lease addendum which provides, among other things, that the tenant will pay the
rent due under the lease directly to the Association upon receipt of notice from the Association
that the Owner is delinquent in amounts due to the Association.
Section 4.

"Irrigation System(s)") for the Common Area and/or any or all of the Lots within Palmero. In the
event Declarant installs one or more Irrigation System(s) for the Common Area and/or any or all
of the Lots within Palmero, the responsibility for operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing
such system(s) shall be governed by the provisions of Article IX below. The foregoing shall in
no way obligate Declarant to install the Irrigation System(s) for the Common Area or within any
or all of the Lots within Palmero. All of costs of the Irrigation System(s) and all usage and
consumption fees for use of water shall be part of the Operating Expenses of the Association.
ARTICLE VII
METHOD OF DETERMINING ASSESSMENTS
AND ALLOCATION OF ASSESSMENTS
Section 1. DETERMINING AMOUNT OF ASSESSMENTS. It shall be the duty of the
Board of Directors to annually prepare a budget ("Budget") covering the estimated Operating
Expenses of the Association. In addition to the Operating Expense Budgets which shall be the
basis for operation and management of the Common Area, the Board of Directors shall annually
attempt to determine the Operating Expenses which would be incurred upon completion of
Palmero, including without limitation any future expansions or additions of Common Area and
number of Lots. Prior to the Turnover, these build-out Budgets shall be utilized in determining
Assessments allocated to Lots by allocating the Operating Expenses among the number of Lots
anticipated to be constructed within Palmero upon build-out. This allocation of Assessments is
undertaken in an effort to fairly allocate the Operating Expenses anticipated upon completion of
Palmero.
Each Lot Ready for Construction, Completed Lot and Incomplete Lot shall be assessed
its pro rata portion of the total anticipated Operating Expenses, which shall be the "Individual
Lot Assessment" as to each Lot. The Individual Lot Assessment shall be based upon the level of
service to each Lot and upon the state of the Lot's development, with the Owners of Lots Ready
for Construction and Completed Lots paying the Operating Expenses on a twenty to one ratio
(20:1) compared to the Owners of Incomplete Lots as set forth below. Therefore, the Builders
owning Lots Ready for Construction, Completed Lot Owners and Incomplete Lot Owners shall
share the payment of the Operating Expenses on a ratio of twenty to one (20:1). Therefore, the
total anticipated Operating Expenses (other than those expenses which are properly the subject of
Special Assessment) shall be divided by the total number of Lots Ready for Construction and
Completed Lots multiplied by twenty (20) plus the number of Incomplete Lots, with the quotient
thus arrived at being the "Individual Lot Assessment" for an Incomplete Lot. Said quotient
multiplied by twenty (20) shall be the Individual Lot Assessment for a Lot Ready for
Construction and a Completed Lot. The number of Lots Ready for Construction Completed Lots
and Incomplete Lots shall be adjusted quarterly, as needed, as hereinafter set forth. At such time
as Declarant has conveyed all of the Homes on all of the Lots, each Lot shall be a Completed Lot
and the Individual Lot Assessment shall be equal for each Lot. Notwithstanding anything in the
Governing Documents to the contrary, any Assessment for Legal Fees incurred by the
Association for lawsuits shall be deemed an Operating Expense which is properly the subject of
Special Assessment and not the subject of an Individual Lot Assessment so long as approved
28
40756179.8

pursuant to Section 12 of Article XV, except the Legal Fees incurred by the Association in
connection with the collection of assessments or other charges which Owners are obligated to
pay pursuant to the Governing Documents or the enforcement of the use and occupancy
restrictions contained in the Governing Documents.
Section 2.
ASSESSMENT PAYMENTS. Individual Lot Assessments shall be payable
quarterly, in advance, on the first day of January, April, July and October of each year, provided,
however, at the Association's option, Individual Lot Assessments may be payable monthly.
Individual Lot Assessments, and the quarterly installments thereof, may be adjusted from time to
time by the Board to reflect changes in the number and status of Completed Lots and Incomplete
Lots (thus apportioning all such Assessments and installments thereof among all Lots at the time
such installment is due) or changes in the Budget or in the event the Board determines that an
Assessment or any installment thereof is either less than or more than the amount actually
required. When an Incomplete Lot becomes a Lot Ready for Construction or a Completed Lot
during a period with respect to which an Assessment or installment thereof has already been
assessed, such Lot Ready for Construction or Completed Lot shall be deemed assessed the
amount of such Assessment or installment thereof which was assessed against Completed Lots in
existence at the time of such Assessment, prorated from the date the Lot became a Completed
Lot through the end of the period in question. If the payment of such Assessment or installment
thereof was due at the time the Lot became a Completed Lot or prior thereto, said prorated
amount thereof shall be immediately due and payable. Likewise, the amount paid with respect to
such Lot Ready for Construction or Completed Lot based upon the Lot's status as an Incomplete
Lot, prorated from the date the Incomplete Lot became a Completed Lot to the end of the period
in question, shall be credited against the amount owed as a Completed Lot.
For purposes of Assessments, a Lot Ready for Construction is assessed the same as a
Completed Lot pursuant to this Declaration.
Section 3.
SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS. "Special Assessments" include, in addition to other
Assessments designated as Special Assessments in the Governing Documents and whether or not
for a cost or expense which is included within the definition of "Operating Expenses," those
Assessments which are levied for capital improvements which include the costs (whether in
whole or in part) of constructing or acquiring Improvements for, or on, the Common Area and/or
the Common Structural Elements which are the responsibility of the Association to maintain as
described in this Declaration (Roofing and Exterior Finish only) or the cost (whether in whole or
in part) of reconstructing or replacing such Improvements. In addition, Special Assessments
may be levied against particular Lots and/or Owners to the exclusion of others. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein contained, it is recognized and declared that Special Assessments
shall be in addition to, and are not part of, any Individual Lot Assessment. Any Special
Assessments assessed against Lots and the Owners thereof shall be paid by such Owners in
addition to any other Assessments and shall be assessed in the same manner and using the same
20:1 ratio as the Individual Lot Assessment. Special Assessments shall be paid in such
installments or in a lump sum as the Board shall, from time to time, determine. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the levying of any Special Assessment after the Turnover Date shall require the
affirmative assent of at least two-thirds (2/3) of all Members represented in person or by proxy at
a meeting called and held in accordance with the Bylaws for all Special Assessments, except
only any Special Assessment for: (a) repair, reconstruction or replacement of damaged or
29
40756179.8

destroyed Improvements previously existing on Common Area (including, without limitation,
landscaping), (b) capital improvements necessary or desirable for the sole purpose of
preservation of, or prevention of damage to Common Area, or (c) up-righting or removing any
fallen or dislodged trees; which shall not require such affirmative assent of at least two-thirds
(2/3) of all Members. Prior to the Turnover Date, a Declarant-controlled Board may make a
Special Assessment without such vote of the Members. Special Assessments are not included in
any deficit funding or subsidizing of the Budget as set forth in Article VII below.
Section 4.
BENEFITED ASSESSMENTS.
The Association may levy Benefited
Assessments against one or more particular Lots as follows:
A.
to cover the costs, including, without limitation, overhead and administrative
costs, of providing services to a Lot upon request of the Owner pursuant to any menu of special
services which the Association may offer or pursuant to a Supplemental Declaration. Benefited
Assessments for special services may be levied in advance of the provision of the requested
service;
B.
to cover the costs incurred in bringing a Lot into compliance with the Governing
Documents, or costs incurred as a consequence of the conduct of the Owner or occupants of the
Lot, their agents, contractors, employees, licensees, invitees, or guests, including, without
limitation, Legal Costs; and
C. to cover costs incurred by the Association for force-placing insurance on any
Townhome, but only amongst those Townhomes with respect to which the Association is being
forced to carry the insurance coverage required by the Owners to be carried herein.
Section 5. LIABILITY OF OWNERS FOR ASSESSMENTS. By the acceptance of a deed
or other instrument of conveyance of a Lot in the Property, each Owner thereof acknowledges
and agrees that each Lot and the Owners thereof are jointly and severally liable for their own
Individual Lot Assessments, any Benefited Assessment against their Lot, and their applicable
portion of any Special Assessments, as well as for any and all other Assessments for which they
are liable, as provided for herein. Such Owners further recognize and covenant that they are
jointly and severally liable with the Owners of all Lots for the Operating Expenses (subject to
any specific limitations provided for herein such as, but not limited to, the limitation with respect
to matters of Special Assessment and the limitations on the liability of Institutional Mortgagees
and their successors and assigns). Accordingly, subject to such specific limitations, it is
recognized and agreed by each Owner, for such Owner and such Owner's heirs, executors,
successors and assigns, that in the event any Owner fails or refuses to pay such Owner's
Individual Lot Assessment or any portion thereof, or such Owner's Benefited Assessment, or
such Owner's respective portion of any Special Assessment or any other Assessment, then the
other Owners may be responsible for increased Individual Lot Assessments, Benefited
Assessments or Special Assessments or other Assessments due to the nonpayment by such other
Owner, and such increased Individual Lot Assessment, Benefited Assessment or Special
Assessment or other Assessment can and may be enforced by the Association and Declarant in
the same manner as all other Assessments hereunder as provided in the Governing Documents.

40756179.8

Section 6.
BUDGETING FOR RESERVES. The Board may, but is not obligated to,
prepare and periodically review separate reserve budgets for the Common Area for which the
Association maintains capital items which takes into account the number and nature of
replaceable completed assets, the expected life of each completed asset, and the expected repair
or replacement cost of capital items under each reserve budget. The Board may include in the
Operating Expense Budget adopted pursuant to Section 1, as appropriate, a contribution to fund
reserves in an amount which the Board, in the exercise of its business judgment, deems sufficient
to meet the projected needs under each reserve budget with respect to both amount and timing by
annual contributions over the budget period. The budgeted amount for reserves need not be for
one hundred percent (100%) of the repair or replacement cost but may be for a lower amount as
determined by the Board. The Board may determine to pool reserves, meaning that a general
reserve fund may be used for any item for which reserves are being collected. Completed Lot
Owners are referred to the then current Budget to determine if reserves are included in the
Budget, the amount budgeted therefor and if Assessments include amounts for reserves.
Reserve funds, if collected, shall be held in a separate account or accounts from the
operating and other funds of the Association.
The reserve funds may be expended only for major maintenance, repair, or replacement
of those assets covered by the reserve budget pursuant to which they were collected. Subject to
such limitation, the Board may adopt resolutions regarding the expenditure of any reserve funds
including, without limitation, policies designating the nature of assets for which reserve funds
may be expended. Neither the Association membership nor the Board shall adopt, modify, limit,
or expand such policies without Declarant's prior written consent during the Development and
Sale Period.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6, or as may be otherwise set forth in
this Declaration, any reserve funds so collected and/or paid pursuant hereto are not created or
established in accordance with Section 720.303(6)(d) of the HOA ACT.
Section 7.
ASSESSMENTS PAYABLE BY DECLARANT: DECLARANT SUBSIDIES.
Each Owner acknowledges and agrees that because Individual Lot Assessments, Benefited
Assessments and Special Assessments are allocated as set forth in this Article VII above, it is
possible that the Association may collect more or less than the amount budgeted for Operating
Expenses in the Budget of the Association. Except as may be limited by applicable law,
Declarant has the right (at its sole election) to: (i) pay Individual Lot Assessments and Benefited
Assessments for the Lots owned by Declarant in the same manner as other Owners (but at the
20: 1 ratio described above), (ii) pay the Deficit (as calculated pursuant to Section 8 below, herein
referred to as the "Deficit"), and/or (iii) subsidize the Budget of the Association as provided
below by making voluntary contributions in amounts determined by Declarant in Declarant's
sole discretion.
During the period of time that Declarant is offering Homes for sale in Palmero and/or
based on the number of Homes owned by Owners other than Declarant, Declarant may seek to
keep Assessments lower than they otherwise may be by subsidizing the Budget of the
Association by making voluntary contributions in amounts determined by Declarant. The amount
of any such voluntary contributions may vary from time to time or may be discontinued and
31
40756179.8

recommenced by Declarant from time to time. The determination to subsidize the Budget of the
Association, the amount of any such voluntary contribution, the discontinuance and/or
recommencement of any such voluntary contributions shall all be made by Declarant in
Declarant's sole discretion and in no event shall Declarant have any obligation whatsoever to
make any such voluntary contributions. Each Owner shall be solely responsible to review the
Budget of the Association then in effect to determine if and to what extent Declarant is making
any voluntary contributions to subsidize the Budget and thus lower the Assessments payable by
the Owners that would otherwise be higher based on the Operating Expenses of the Association.
Section 8.
DECLARANT'S OPTION TO FUND BUDGET DEFICITS. To the extent
permitted by Florida law, until the end of the Development and Sale Period, Declarant may
satisfy the obligation for Assessments on Lots which it owns either by paying Assessments in the
same manner as any other Owner (but at the 20:1 ratio described above) or by funding the budget
Deficit. The budget deficit ("Deficit") is the difference between (i) the amount of Assessments
levied on Owners' Lots plus any other income, revenue or sums received by the Association
during the period during which Declarant has elected to fund the Deficit, and (ii) the amount of
the Association's actual expenditures during the fiscal year and excluding to the maximum
extent allowable by law, contributions to reserves, if any, and Special Assessments arising as a
result of any unusual loss or liability. The calculation of Declarant's Deficit funding obligation
shall be done on a cumulative basis (from the inception of the election to fund the Deficit until
Declarant's election to cease funding the Deficit) although Declarant will fund the Association to
meet its cash flow obligations as they arise during the Deficit funding period. Should Declarant,
in its sole discretion, elect to fund cash shortfalls caused by delinquencies or other matters which
would not otherwise require deficit funds from Declarant, such funds shall be considered a loan
to the Association to be paid back to Declarant by the Association. Declarant is not required to
make contributions to reserves while Deficit funding even though Owners other than Declarant
may be required to make such contributions.
Unless Declarant otherwise notifies the Board in writing, Declarant shall continue paying
on the same basis as during the previous fiscal year. Regardless of Declarant's election,
Declarant's Assessment obligations may be satisfied in the form of cash or by "in kind"
contributions of services or materials, or by a combination of these, the value of which shall be
reasonably determined by Declarant. After the end of the Development and Sale Period, or
sooner if Declarant elects to pay Assessments and cease Deficit funding, Declarant shall pay
Assessments on Lots which it or its affiliates own in the same manner as any other Owner.
Declarant's obligation to Deficit fund is not a guarantee of the Assessments or Operating
Expenses as contemplated by Florida Statutes Section 720.308 because the amount of
Assessments or Operating Expenses to be paid by Owners during any Deficit funding period may
change based upon changes in the then buildout Budget.
Section 9.
DECLARANT'S PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS, DEFICIT FUNDING,
AND/OR SUBSIDIZING THE BUDGET. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, if Declarant elects to Deficit fund or provide a subsidy to lower the Assessments due
from Owners prior to the end of the Development and Sale Period, or such other time as
Declarant, in its sole discretion desires to discontinue such Deficit funding or subsidy, Declarant
will not retroactively recalculate any Assessments for any period during which Declarant was
32
40756179.8

Deficit funding and/or subsidizing the budget on the 20:1 ratio as described in Section 1 above,
however, the Deficit funding or subsidy shall be calculated on a cumulative basis as set forth in
Section 8 above.
Section 10. WORKING FUND CONTRIBUTION. Each subsequent Owner of a Lot
(meaning any Owner who purchases a Lot from a previous Owner other than Declarant or a
Builder) shall pay to the Association a Working Fund Contribution at the time legal title is
conveyed to such Owner by the previous Owner. The Working Fund Contribution shall be Two
Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($2,500.00) for each Lot and each subsequent
conveyance of the Lot. In the event an Institutional Mortgagee acquires title through foreclosure
or a deed in lieu, the Institutional Mortgagee shall be exempt from paying such Working Fund
Contribution. The purpose of the Working Fund Contribution is to ensure that the Association
will have cash available for initial start-up expenses, to meet unforeseen expenditures and to
acquire additional equipment and services deemed necessary or desirable by the Board. Working
Fund Contributions are not advance payments of Individual Lot Assessments and shall have no
effect on future Individual Lot Assessments, nor will they be held in reserve. Working Fund
Contributions may also be used to offset Operating Expenses and fund any deficit between
yearly Operating Expenses and income collected from Assessments. Declarant may, in its sole
discretion, move any Working Fund Contributions not used for Operating Expenses into a
reserve account at the time of the Turnover Date.
Section 11. WAIVER OF USE. No Owner, other than Declarant, may exempt himself from
personal liability for Assessments duly levied by the Association. No Owner may release the Lot
owned by such Owner from the liens and charges hereof either by waiver of the use and
enjoyment of the Common Area and the facilities thereon or by abandonment of such Owner's
Home
ARTICLE VIII
ARCHITECTURAL CONTROL COMMITTEE
Section 1.
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. The Architectural Control Committee,
sometimes referred to in this Declaration as the "Committee," shall be comprised of three (3)
members. The initial members of the Committee shall consist of persons designated by
Declarant. Each of said persons shall hold office until all Lots and Homes have been conveyed
or such earlier time as Declarant may, at its sole option, elect. Thereafter, each new member of
the Committee shall be appointed by the Board and shall hold office until such time as such new
member has resigned, has been removed, or such new member's successor has been appointed,
as provided herein. Members of the Committee, other than those designated by Declarant, may
be removed at any time without cause. The Board shall have the sole right to appoint and
remove all members of the Committee other than those designated by Declarant.
Section 2.
REVIEW OF PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION.
A.
No Improvements, including, by way of example and not of limitation, accessory
structures, exterior lighting fixtures, brick pavers, stamped concrete, concrete flatwork,
basketball goals, gym sets and play structures, buildings, fences, walls, pools, roofs, gutters or
rain spouts, antennae, aerials, microwave reception devices, mailboxes, external enclosures or
33
40756179.8

attachments (including entry screen and patio screen enclosures), or landscaping (including
hedges, massed plantings and trees) shall be commenced, erected, installed, altered, modified,
painted, planted, or maintained on the Property, including the Lots, nor shall any canopies,
shutters, or window coverings be attached to or placed upon outside walls or roofs of any Home
or building by any Owner other than Declarant, unless such Improvements have been reviewed
by and received the written approval of the Committee in accordance with Paragraph B below.
Any Owner desiring to make Improvements shall submit two (2) complete sets of plans and
specifications prepared by an architect, landscape architect, engineer or other person determined
by the Committee to be qualified, showing the nature, dimensions, materials and location of the
same, together with the security deposit if required by the Committee, to be held and disbursed
by the Association in accordance with Section 3 below.
B.
The Committee shall approve proposed plans and specifications submitted for its
approval only if it deems that the construction, alterations or additions contemplated will not be
detrimental to the appearance of the surrounding area of the Property as a whole, and that the
appearance of any structure affected thereby will be in harmony with the surrounding structures
and is otherwise desirable. The Committee may also issue and amend from time to time rules or
guidelines setting forth procedures for the submission of plans and specifications. If the
proposed construction, alterations or additions are to a portion of the Improvements which the
Association is obligated to maintain, said approval shall also be subject to approval by the Board.
The Committee may condition its approval of proposed plans and specifications in such a
manner as it deems appropriate and may require the submission of additional information prior to
approving or disapproving such plans.
c.
The Committee shall have forty-five (45) days after delivery of all required
materials to give written approval or rejection of any such plans and, if written approval is not
given within such forty-five (45) day period, such plans shall be deemed rejected, provided
however, that, in any event, no such addition, construction or alteration shall be made by any
Owner which is detrimental to or inconsistent with the harmony, appearance or general scheme
of the Property as a whole.
D.
No landscaping or other Improvements beyond the buildable areas on the Lake
Lots which materially interfere with the view of the Lakes by immediate neighbors who are also
Lake Lot Owners shall be permitted. In its review of proposed plans and specifications of
landscape design and materials for Lake Lots, including, but not limited to, any massed
plantings, the Committee will take into consideration the effect on Lake views of such
landscaping, both at the proposed time of installation and at the time when maximum growth
shall have occurred. No Owner shall be permitted to install any fence (or landscaping) within
any Lake maintenance easement whatsoever (Refer to Article X, Section 19 for additional
restrictions regarding fences).
E.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Article to the contrary, the approval of the
Committee shall not be required for any additions, changes or alterations within any Home if
such additions, changes or alterations are not visible from the outside of such Home. All
changes and alterations shall be subject, independently, to all applicable governmental laws,
statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations.
34
40756179.8

F.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, no construction,
reconstruction, addition or alteration by Declarant shall require the prior approval or any
certificate of consent of the Committee or any security deposit.
Section 3. SECURITY DEPOSIT FOR IMPROVEMENTS: INDEMNIFICATION, Any
Owner desiring to make Improvements may be required by the Committee, depending upon the
Improvements being requested and the manner of installation of such Improvements, to provide
to the Committee, at the time of the Owner's submission of plans and specifications for review
and approval by the Reviewer, a Five Thousand Dollar ($5,000.00) security deposit to cover
costs of incidental damage caused to Common Area, an adjacent Home or Lot, or any other
property (whether real or personal) by virtue of such Owner's construction of Improvements.
The Committee shall have the sole and absolute discretion to determine whether a security
deposit is required for the Improvements being requested. The Committee shall not be obligated
to place the security deposit in an interest bearing account. The Owner shall be entitled to the
return of the security deposit upon: (i) such Owner's written notice to the Committee that the
Improvements covered by the security deposit have been completed in accordance with the plans
and specifications approved by the Committee, and (ii) the Committee's (or its duly authorized
representative's) inspection of such Improvements confirming completion; provided, however,
should any incidental damage be caused to Common Area by virtue of such Owner's
construction of Improvements, the security deposit shall not be returned to Owner until such
damages have been repaired. In the event that Owner has not repaired such damages to the
Common Area to the satisfaction of the Committee, the Committee shall have the right (but not
the obligation), after five (5) days' notice to the offending Owner, to repair such incidental
damage and to use so much of the security deposit held by the Committee to reimburse itself for
the costs of such work. Further, the offending Owner hereby agrees to indemnify and reimburse
the Committee for all reasonable costs expended by the Committee that exceed the security
deposit, including Legal Fees, if any, incurred in connection therewith. Should any incidental
damage be caused to an adjacent Lot or Home by virtue of such Owner's construction of
Improvements, the Owner of the adjacent Lot (the "Adjacent Lot Owner") may, at such Adjacent
Lot Owner's sole option: (a) remedy such damage and submit to the Committee a receipt,
invoice or statement therefor for reimbursement from the offending Owner's security deposit; or
(b) allow the offending Owner to repair such incidental damage to the Adjacent Lot Owner's Lot
or Home, at the offending Owner's sole cost and expense, and upon receipt by the Committee of
written notice from the Adjacent Lot Owner that such incidental damage has been repaired, the
offending Owner shall be entitled to a return of the balance of the security deposit being held by
the Committee, if any.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary, the Committee return
of the security deposit being held by it for any such Improvements shall be based solely on
considerations set forth above. The Committee's return of the security deposit does not and shall
not be construed to constitute a determination by members and representatives of the Committee,
Declarant, and/or the Association of the structural safety, approval or integrity of any
Improvement, conformance with building or other codes or standards, or the proper issuance of
governmental permits and approvals for any Improvement. By submitting a request for review
and approval of proposed plans and specifications, along with the security deposit required
hereunder, an Owner shall be deemed to have automatically agreed to hold harmless and
indemnify the members and representatives of the Committee, Declarant, and the Association
:35
40756179.8

generally, from any loss, claim, damage or liability connected with or arising out of the
Improvements or alterations, and/or the security deposit (including, without limitation, the
disbursement thereof).
The Committee shall not be liable or responsible to anyone for any damages, losses or
expenses resulting from the Committee's holding of the security deposit or disbursement thereof
unless same shall be caused by the gross negligence or willful malfeasance of the Committee. In
the event of any disagreement relating to the security deposit held by the Committee or the
disbursement thereof, the Committee shall be entitled (but not obligated) to refuse to disburse the
security deposit (or any portion thereof) as long as such disagreement may continue, and the
Committee shall not become liable in any way for such refusal. The Committee shall have the
right, at any time, after a dispute has arisen, to pay the security deposit (or any portion thereof)
held by it into any court of competent jurisdiction for payment to the appropriate party,
whereupon the Committee's obligations hereunder shall terminate and the Committee shall be
automatically released of any and all obligations.
Section 4.
MEETINGS OF THE COMMITTEE. The Committee shall meet from time to
time as necessary to perform its duties hereunder. The Committee may from time to time, by
resolution unanimously adopted in writing, designate a Committee representative (who may, but
need not, be one of its members) to take any action or perform any duties for and on behalf of the
Committee. In the absence of such designation, the vote of any two (2) members of the
Committee shall constitute an act of the Committee.
Section 5.
NO WAIVER OF FUTURE APPROVALS. The approval of the Committee of
any plans and specifications or drawings for any work performed or proposed shall not be
deemed to constitute a waiver of any right to withhold approval or consent to any identical or
similar proposal subsequently or additionally submitted for approval or consent, whether such
submission is by that applicant or another applicant. Similarly, the denial of approval by the
Committee of any plans and specifications or drawings for any work performed or proposed shall
not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any right to approve or consent to any identical or similar
proposal subsequently or additionally submitted for approval or consent, whether such
submission is by that applicant or another applicant.
Section 6.
COMPENSATION OF MEMBERS. The members of the Committee shall
receive no compensation for services rendered, other than reimbursement for expenses incurred
by them in the performance of their duties hereunder.
Section 7.
INSPECTION OF WORK. Inspection of work and correction of defects therein
shall proceed as follows:
this Article, the submitting party shall give written notice of completion to the Committee.
A.
Upon the completion of any work for which approved plans are required under
B. Within thirty (30) days after written notice of completion, the Committee or its
duly authorized representatives may inspect such Improvement. If the Committee finds such
work was not done in substantial compliance with the approved plans, it shall notify the
submitting party in writing of such noncompliance within such thirty (30) day period, specifying
36
40756179.8

the particulars of noncompliance, and shall require the submitting party to remedy such
noncompliance.
C. If upon the expiration of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notification the
submitting party shall have failed to remedy such noncompliance, notification shall be given to
the Board in writing of such failure. Upon such notice, the Board shall determine whether there
is a noncompliance and, if so, the nature thereof and the estimated cost of correcting or removing
the same. If noncompliance exists, the submitting party shall remedy or remove the same within
a period of not more than thirty (30) days from the date of announcement of the Board's ruling.
If the submitting party does not comply with the Board's ruling within such period, the Board, at
its option, may remove the Improvement, remedy the noncompliance, or proceed in court to
compel compliance and the submitting party shall reimburse the Association, upon demand, for
all expenses incurred in connection therewith, including Interest and Legal Fees. If such
expenses are not promptly repaid by the submitting party to the Association, the Board shall levy
an Assessment against such submitting party for reimbursement, and said Assessment shall
constitute a lien upon the applicable Lot and Home with the same force and effect as liens for
Operating Expenses.
D.
If, for any reason, notification is not given to the submitting party of acceptance
within thirty (30) days after receipt of said written notice of completion from the submitting
party, the Improvement and/or alteration shall be deemed to be in compliance with said approved
plans.
Section 8.
NON-LIABILITY OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS. Neither the Committee nor
any member thereof, nor its duly authorized Committee representative, nor Declarant, shall be
liable to the Association or an Owner or any other person or entity for any loss, damage or injury
arising out of or in any way connected with the performance of the Committee's duties
hereunder, unless due to the willful misconduct or bad faith of a member and only that member
shall have any liability. The Committee's review and approval or disapproval of plans submitted
to it for any proposed Improvement shall be based solely on considerations of the overall benefit
or detriment to the community as a whole. The Committee shall not be responsible for
reviewing, nor shall its approval of any plan or design be deemed approval of, any plan or design
from the standpoint of structural safety or conformance with building or other codes or standards,
and no member or representative of the Committee or the Association, nor Declarant, shall be
liable for the safety, soundness, workmanship, materials or usefulness for any purpose of any
such Improvement or alteration proposed by the plans. By submitting a request for review and
approval by the Committee, an Owner shall be deemed to have and does automatically agree to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Committee, the Association and Declarant (and each of
their respective officers, directors, partners, affiliates, representatives and members) from and
against any and all claims, causes of action, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, Legal Fees) arising from, relating to or in any way connected with
the Improvement or alterations for which such request was submitted and/or the security deposit
(including, without limitation, the disbursement thereof). Furthermore, approval by the
Committee of any request does not excuse any Owner from also obtaining approvals from all
applicable governmental authorities.

40756179.8

Section 9.
VARIANCE. The Committee may authorize variances from compliance with any
of the architectural provisions of this Declaration or any Supplemental Declaration, when
circumstances such as topography, natural obstructions, hardship, aesthetic or environmental
considerations may require; provided, however, the Committee shall not give or authorize (and
the Committee is hereby prohibited from giving or authorizing) any variance with respect to the
displaying of any signs for the sale or renting of the Home as prohibited in Article X, Section 13
below. If such variances are granted, no violation of the covenants, conditions and restrictions
contained in this Declaration or any Supplemental Declaration shall be deemed to have occurred
with respect to the Improvements for which the variance was granted.
Section 10. DECLARANT EXEMPTION. Declarant is hereby exempt from having to
comply with the requirements of this Article VIII in its entirety.
Section 11. COMMUNITY STANDARD. To ensure the preservation of the existing
harmonious design and to prevent the introduction of design that is not in keeping with Palmero,
Declarant hereby declares that the style and form of Palmero, as originally constructed or
approved by Declarant, with respect to architectural style, colors and materials as the standard.
This standard shall continue in effect until the adoption and publication of new guidelines and
standards.
ARTICLE IX
MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OBLIGATIONS
Section 1.
BY THE ASSOCIATION.
A.
The Association, at its expense, shall be responsible for the operation,
maintenance, repair and replacement of all of the Improvements and facilities located over,
through and upon the Common Area as otherwise provided herein (except public utilities to the
extent same have not been made Common Area). Should any incidental damage be caused to
any Home by virtue of the Association's failure to maintain the Common Area as herein required
or by virtue of any work which may be performed or caused to be performed by the Association
in the maintenance, repair or replacement of any Common Area, the Association shall, at its
expense, repair such incidental damage. The Association shall not, however, be responsible for
any loss of use, any hardship, an Owner's time or any other consequential or punitive damages.
B.
The Association shall be responsible for the maintenance, care and replacement of
the lawn encompassed within a Townhome Lot. "Maintenance, care and replacement" within
the meaning of this subsection shall include, mowing, edging, fertilizing and spraying of lawns,
and replacement of landscaping, sod and mulch.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Association shall have the right, but not the
obligation, following a tropical storm, hurricane or other Act of God, to upright and/or remove
any fallen or dislodged trees, at the respective Owner's cost and expense on (i) any Lot, and/or
(ii) any grassed areas located between the front and/or side(s) of such Owner's Lot and the street;
on behalf of the Owner of such Lot. The Owner of said Lot shall be required to reimburse the
Association for the costs and expenses incurred by the Association in connection with the
uprighting and/or removal of any fallen or dislodged trees. In that regard, the Association may
38
40756179.8

levy a Special Assessment against such Lot in connection with such costs and expenses, to the
exclusion of all other Owners, without the need for obtaining the affirmative assent of at least
two-thirds (2/3) of all Members as set forth in Section 3 of Article VII.
C.
The Association shall operate, maintain, repair and replace the Irrigation
System(s) serving the Common Area and the Townhomes. The Association shall be responsible
for the costs of operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of such Irrigation System(s),

The Association has a reasonable right of entry upon any Lot to make emergency
repairs and to do other work reasonably necessary for the proper maintenance and operation of
Palmero.
O.
While the Association may agree to provide certain maintenance services to

any Townhome or any improvements thereon or attached thereon. In the event that any damage
or injury occurs to any Owner or occupant of a Townhome as a result of the failure of the
Association to perform such maintenance, the Association's liability shall be limited to
performing the maintenance otherwise required by this Declaration, and the Association shall not
be responsible for consequential damages, personal injury or punitive damages of any kind.
Declarant may have provided Owners with warranties that extend for some period of time after

covered by any existing warranties.
P.
After the Turnover Date, the Association, by action of its Board, may make any
minor and insubstantial alteration or Improvement to the Common Area having a cost not in

proxy at a meeting called and held in accordance with the Bylaws. No alteration or
Improvement may be made to the Common Area which materially and adversely affects the
rights of the Owner of any Lot to the enjoyment of such Owner's Lot or the Common Area
unless the Owner and all mortgagees holding recorded mortgages on such Lot consent thereto in
41
40756179.8

writing. Prior to the Turnover Date, all alterations and Improvements to the Common Area shall
be in Declarant's sole and absolute discretion.
Section 2.
BY THE OWNERS.
A.
The Owner of each Lot must keep and maintain the Lot and the Improvements
thereon, to the extent not otherwise maintained by the Association as provided for herein (for the
single-family Lots only, this includes mowing, fertilizing, edging, watering, pruning, and
replacing, and controlling disease and insects of all lawns and landscaping installed on the
single-family Lots), equipment and appurtenances, in good order, condition and repair, and must
perform promptly all maintenance and repair work within, upon and outside of such Owner's
Home which, if omitted, could adversely affect Palmero, the other Owners or the Association
and its Members. The Owner of each Lot shall be responsible for any damages caused by a
failure to so maintain such Lot, Improvements and Home. The Owners' responsibility for
maintenance, repair and replacement shall include, but not be limited to, all of the physical
structures constructed in, upon, above or below the Lot, and physical items attached or connected
to such structures that run beyond the boundary line of the Lot which exclusively service or
benefit the Lot and Home, to the extent not otherwise maintained by the Association as provided
for herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Owner of each Lot shall keep all
drainage structures (such as catch basins) located on the Owner's Lot clear of grass, leaves and
other debris. Additionally, the painting, caulking and maintenance of the exterior surface of all
walls, doors, windows and roof of the physical structure of the Home shall be performed by the
Owner, and the exterior surface of such walls, doors, windows and roof shall at all times be
maintained in a good and serviceable condition with no damage or other defect therein by the
Owner, to the extent not otherwise maintained by the Association as provided for herein. The
Owner of a Lot further agrees to pay for all utilities, such as telephone, cable or satellite
television, water, sewer, sanitation, electric, etc ., that may be separately billed or charged to each
Home. The Owner of each Lot shall be responsible for insect and pest control within the Home
and the Lot. Whenever the maintenance, repair and replacement of any items which an Owner is
obligated to maintain, repair or replace at such Owner's own expense is occasioned by any loss
or damage which may be covered by any insurance maintained in force by the Association, the
proceeds of the insurance received by the Association shall be used for the purpose of making
such maintenance, repair or replacement, except that the Owner shall be, in said instance,
required to pay such portion of the costs of such maintenance, repair and replacement as shall, by
reason of the applicability of any deductibility provision of such insurance or otherwise, reduce
the amount of the insurance proceeds applicable to such maintenance, repair or replacement.
If an Owner makes any modifications, installations or additions to his or her
Townhome or the Common Structural Elements, the Owner and his or her successors in title
shall be financially responsible for the insurance, maintenance, repair and replacement of the
modifications, installations or additions, as well as the cost of repairing any damage to the
Common Structural Elements resulting from such modifications or additions. Whenever an
Owner contracts for the maintenance, repair, replacement, alteration, addition or improvement of
any portion of the Townhome or the Common Structural Elements, whether with or without the
Association's approval, such Owner shall be deemed to have warranted to the Association and
their respective members that his or her contractor(s) are properly licensed and fully insured and
that the Owner will be financially responsible for any resulting damage to persons or property
42
40756179.8

not paid by the contractor's insurance. The Owner also agrees to comply with the requirements
of Chapter 713, Florida Statutes, and to indemnify the Association and its members from any
construction liens which may attach to the Property and which are attributable to work performed
by or for the benefit of the Owner.
In addition to the foregoing, the Owner of each Home shall be required to
maintain appropriate climate control, keep his or her Home clean, promptly repair any leaks and
take necessary measures to retard and prevent mold, fungi, mildew and mycotoxins from
accumulating in the Home. Each Owner shall be required to clean and dust such Owner's Home
on a regular basis and to remove visible moisture accumulation on windows, window sills, walls,
floors, ceilings and other surfaces as soon as reasonably possible and must not block or cover
any heating, ventilation or air-conditioning ducts, and to properly maintain and have serviced on
a regular basis, the Home's HVAC system. Each Owner of a Home shall be responsible for
damage to such Owner's Home and personal property as well as any injury to the Owner of a
Home and/or occupants of the Home resulting from the Owner's failure to comply with these
terms. Each Owner of a Home shall be responsible for the repair and remediation of all damages
to the Home caused by mold, fungi, mildew and mycotoxins. While the foregoing are intended to
minimize the potential developments of molds, fungi, mildew and other mycotoxins, each Owner
understands and agrees that there is no method for completely eliminating the development of
same. Declarant does not make any representations or warranties regarding the existence or
development of molds, fungi, mildew or mycotoxins, and each Owner on behalf of themselves
and their family members, guests, invitees, tenants, successors and assigns shall be deemed to
and by acceptance of a deed or title to the Home or by use of the Home, waives and expressly
releases any such warranty and claims for loss or damages (including, without limitation,
property damage and/or personal injury) resulting from the existence and/or development of
same.
In addition to the above, Owners of all Homes shall be responsible to: fix leaks in
and otherwise maintain and repair the roofs of their Homes, to the extent not otherwise
maintained by the Association as provided for herein; replace any dead or obviously dying trees
on their Lots; and maintain, repair and replace any fences on their Lots except as otherwise
provided in Article IX, Section 1.G above. Owners of Homes shall also clean, maintain, repair
and replace the driveways located on their Lots and keep the sidewalks, if any, located on or
contiguous to their Lots clean and free from any stains, trash, debris and/or impediments to
pedestrian traffic.
B. If a single-family Home is damaged by fire or other casualty, its Owner shall
properly and promptly restore it to at least as good a condition as it was before the casualty
occurred. Any such work shall be in accordance with the original plans and specifications of the
Home unless otherwise authorized by the Board and shall be otherwise subject to all provisions
of Article VIII hereof.
In the event of damage to or destruction of a Townhome, the Association shall
promptly repair or reconstruct the Townhome in a manner consistent with the original
construction or other plans and specifications using the insurance proceeds and to the extent the
insurance proceeds are inadequate, the Owner or Owners whose Townhomes have been damaged
shall be responsible for the deficiency between the costs of the repair and the proceeds from the
43
40756179.8

insurance. Further, the Association shall be entitled to levy on the Townhome Owner an
Assessment or special charge equal to the cost of performing such repair or reconstruction and
any such Assessment or special charge shall constitute a lien upon the applicable Townhome
with the same force and effect as a lien for Operating Expenses.
C.
Each Owner shall keep such Owner's Home insured in an amount not less than its
full insurable value against loss or damage by fire or other hazards. In addition, every Owner
shall be obligated to obtain and maintain at all times insurance covering consequential damages
to any other Lot or the Common Area due to occurrences originating within the Owner's Lot
caused by the negligence of the Owner, the failure of the Owner to maintain the Lot, and any
other casualty within the Lot which causes damage to the Lots owned by others or the Common
Area, to the extent such coverage is not provided by policies maintained by the Association or to
the extent insurable losses may result in the Owner's liability for payment of deductibles under
the Association's policies. Such insurance policy or policies shall name the Association as an
additional insured. Unless a Mortgagee is named as the loss payee under any such policy, the
Association shall be named as an additional loss payee.
D. If an Owner fails to comply with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2, the
Association may proceed in court to compel compliance. Further, if the failure to comply relates
to the Owner's obligations to maintain insurance, the Association shall be entitled, although not
obligated, to obtain the required coverage itself and to levy on the offending Owner an
Assessment equal to the cost of premiums, and any such Assessment shall constitute a lien upon
the applicable Lot and Home with the same force and effect as a lien for Operating Expenses.
E.
If a failure to comply with the provisions of this Section 2 relates to the Owner's
obligation to maintain and care for the Home, landscaping or any other area required to be
maintained and cared for by the Owner, then, in addition to the exercise of all other remedies, the
Association or Declarant shall have the right but not the obligation, upon fifteen (15) days
written notice, to enter upon the Lot of the Owner for the purpose of performing the maintenance
and care referred to, set forth and described in the notice, and to levy on the offending Owner an
Assessment equal to the cost of performing such maintenance and care. Any such Assessment
shall constitute a lien upon the applicable Lot and Home with the same force and effect as a lien
for Operating Expenses. The determination of whether an Owner is failing to properly maintain
and care for the property for which he has the maintenance responsibility under this Declaration
or any of the other Governing Documents shall be determined in the sole discretion of the
Association or Declarant.
F.
The Association shall control the timers for post lights installed by Declarant, if
any, in the front yards of Homes, however, Owners are responsible for the replacement of the
light bulbs, and the maintenance, repair and replacement of the post lights installed in their front
yards. Owners are required to immediately replace any burned out bulbs in such post lights. If
the Owner fails to perform its maintenance responsibility as required herein the Association may
perform such maintenance and assess the costs against the Owner as a Benefited Assessment.
Section 3.
DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS. The Owner of any Home which has suffered
damage may apply to the Committee for approval for reconstruction, rebuilding, or repair of the
Improvements therein. The Committee shall grant such approval only if, upon completion of the
44
40756179.8

work, the exterior appearance of the Improvement(s) will be substantially similar to that which
existed prior to the date of the casualty. If the obligation for repair falls upon the Association,
the Committee approval will not be required prior to the commencement of such work, so long
as the exterior appearance of the Improvement(s) will be substantially similar to that which
existed prior to the date of the casualty.
The owner or owners of any damaged building (including, without limitation, the Owner
of a Lot and/or Home), the Association, and the Committee shall be obligated to proceed with all
due diligence hereunder and the responsible parties shall commence reconstruction within three
(3) months after the damage occurs and complete reconstruction within one (1) year after the
damage occurs, unless prevented by causes beyond his or its reasonable control.
Declarant shall be exempt from the provisions of this Section 3, provided that any such
reconstruction, rebuilding or repairs made by Declarant shall be consistent, as to the exterior
appearance, with the Improvements as they existed prior to the damage or other casualty.
ARTICLE X
USE RESTRICTIONS
All of the Property shall be held, used, and enjoyed subject to the following limitations
and restrictions, and any and all additional rules and regulations which may, from time to time,
be adopted by the Association, except as provided in Article X, Section 26 below:
Section 1. ENFORCEMENT. Failure of an Owner to comply with any limitations or
restrictions in this Declaration or any of the Governing Documents or with any rules and
regulations promulgated by the Association shall be grounds for action which may include,
without limitation, an action to recover sums due for damages, injunctive relief, or any
combination thereof. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, an Owner shall also be
responsible for the payment of any and all Legal Fees incurred by the Association in connection
with the enforcement of this Declaration or any of the Governing Documents or with any rules or
regulations promulgated by the Association, whether or not an action is actually begun. Any
such Legal Fees shall be paid not later than thirty (30) days after written notice thereof and if not
paid within such thirty (30) day period, shall constitute a lien upon the applicable Lot and Home
with the same force and effect as a lien for Operating Expenses.
In addition to all other remedies, the Association may suspend, for a reasonable period of
time, any or all of the rights of an Owner or an Owner's tenants, guests or invitees to use
Common Area and facilities; may suspend the voting rights of an Owner if such Owner is
delinquent in payment of assessments for more than ninety (90) days; and may levy reasonable
fines against any Owner or any Owner's tenant, guest or invitee for failure of such Owner, and/or
such Owner's family, guests, invitees, tenants or employees to comply with any of the
Governing Documents, provided the following procedures are adhered to:
A. Notice. The Association shall notify the Owner in writing of the noncompliance
and set forth the corrective action to be taken. A fine or suspension of use rights may not be
imposed without notice of at least fourteen (14) days to the Owner sought to be fined or
suspended and an opportunity for a hearing before a committee of at least three (3) members
45
40756179.8

appointed by the Board who are not officers, directors, or employees of the Association, or the
spouse, parent, child, brother or sister of an officer, director, or employee of the Association. If
the committee, by majority vote, does not approve a proposed fine or suspension, it may not be
imposed. At the Association's option, any fine may be levied on a daily basis in the event of a
continuing violation without the necessity of a new hearing and without any limitation on the
amount of such fine.
B.
Hearing. Should the Owner still be in noncompliance, the noncompliance shall be
presented to the Board after which the Board shall hear reasons why a fine should or should not
be imposed. A written decision of the Board shall be submitted to the Owner, as applicable, not
later than twenty-one (21) days after said meeting.
C.
Payment. A fine shall be paid not later than thirty (30) days after notice of the
imposition of the fine.
D. Fines. A fine shall be treated as an Assessment subject to the provisions of the
collection of Assessments as otherwise set forth herein. All monies received from fines shall be
allocated as directed by the Board, subject always to the provisions of this Declaration.
E. Failure to Pay Assessments. Notice and Hearing as provided in Subparagraphs A
and B above shall not be required with respect to the imposition of suspension of use rights or
fines upon any Owner because of such Owner's failure to pay Assessments or other charges
when due.
F.
Access. Suspension of use rights to Common Area shall not impair the right of an
Owner or tenant of a Lot and/or Home to have vehicular and pedestrian ingress to and egress
from such Lot and/or Home, including, but not limited to, the right to park.
Section 2.
SINGLE-FAMILY USE. The Homes shall be for single-family use only. No
commercial occupation or activity may be carried on in Palmero except as such occupation or
activity is permitted to be carried on by Declarant under this Declaration. A single-family is
defined to mean any number of persons related by blood, marriage or adoption or not more than
two (2) unrelated persons living as a single housekeeping unit.
Section 3.
HOMES OWNED BY ENTITIES OR UNRELATED PERSONS. It is the
intention that Homes be occupied for single-family use. In the event an entity owns a Home, the
entity shall notify the Association in writing with the names of the family members who shall
occupy the Home. In the event the Owners of the Home are unrelated either through blood or
marriage, they shall be permitted to occupy the Home provided they live as a family unit similar
to a husband and wife. No Home may be used as a rooming house, hostel, or hotel. Timesharing
or other arrangements involving more than three ownership interests in a Lot (including
ownership by more than three persons as joint tenants or tenants-in-common), or assigning
separate use periods of less than ninety (90) consecutive days' duration, are prohibited.
Section 4.
NUISANCES. No obnoxious or offensive activity shall be carried on or about the
Lots or in or about any Improvements, Homes, or on any portion of Palmero nor shall anything
be done therein which may be or become an unreasonable annoyance or a nuisance to any
46
40756179.8

Owner. No use or practice shall be allowed in or around the Homes which is a source of
annoyance to Owners or occupants of Homes or which interferes with the peaceful possession or
proper use of the Homes or the surrounding areas. No loud noises or noxious odors shall be
permitted in any Improvements, Homes or Lots. Without limiting the generality of any of the
foregoing provisions, no horns, whistles, bells or other sound devices (other than security devices
used exclusively for security purposes), noisy or smoky vehicles, unlicensed off-road motor
vehicles or any items which may unreasonably interfere with television or radio reception of any
Owner shall be located, used or placed on any Lot, or exposed to the view of other Owners
without the prior written approval of the Board.
Section 5. PARKING AND VEHICULAR RESTRICTIONS. Parking upon the Property
shall be restricted to the driveway and garage located upon each Lot and designated parking
areas within the Common Area. No parking on the streets or swales is permitted, however, if the
Owner is having a private party or event, the guests may park on the street for a period not to
exceed eight (8) hours. Overnight parking on the streets is prohibited. No Owner shall keep any
vehicle on any Lot which is deemed to be a nuisance by the Board. No Owner shall conduct
repairs taking more than twenty-four (24) hours (except in an emergency or except within the
garage of the Home with the garage door closed) or restorations of any motor vehicle, boat,
trailer, or other vehicle upon any Lot. No commercial vehicle (excluding all police, fire and
other public safety vehicles), trailer, recreational vehicle, boat or boat trailer may be parked or
stored on the Property except in the garage of a Home located upon a Lot. No bus or
tractor-trailer or any other truck larger than a full-size pickup truck may be parked on the
Property, except temporarily as in the case of a moving van or other such vehicle necessary to
provide service to an Owner and with the exception of any vehicles necessary for any
construction activity being performed by or on behalf of Declarant.
Section 6.
NO IMPROPER USE. No improper, offensive, hazardous or unlawful use shall
be made of any Home nor shall anything be done thereon tending to cause embarrassment,
discomfort, annoyance or nuisance to any person using any portion of the Property. All valid
laws, zoning ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, codes and other requirements of all
governmental bodies having jurisdiction thereover shall be observed. Violations of laws,
ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, codes or other requirements of any governmental agency
having jurisdiction thereover relating to any Home or Lot shall be corrected by, and at the sole
expense of the Owner of said Home and/or Lot.
Section 7. LEASES. No portion of a Home (other than an entire Home) may be rented. All
leases must be in writing and shall have a term of no less than one (1) month. No Owner may
lease his or her Home more than five (5) times in any 12-month period, even if a tenant defaults
on a lease or abandons the Home before expiration of the lease term. To preserve the non-
transient, single family residential, nature of the Property, no Home, or portion of a Home, may
be listed or advertised as being available for rent, lease, sublease, license, use or occupancy, on
any internet website or web-based platform, including, without limitation, airbnb.com, vrbo.com,
homeaway.com or any other similar website or web-based platform, regardless of the term or
duration of such rental, lease, sublease, license or occupancy. This restriction shall not prohibit
the use of an MLS listing service or similar internet website or web-based platform by Owners
for leasing activities permitted under this Declaration. No lease shall provide for an early lease
termination which would reduce a lease term to a period of less than said one (1) month, except
47
40756179.8

in the event of a default by the tenant. Any lease terminated as a result of a default or otherwise,
shall nevertheless still count towards the foregoing rental limitations. The restrictions on lease
terms set forth in this paragraph shall not apply to Homes owned or leased by Declarant, its
Affiliates, or Persons Declarant approves, in connection with their development, construction, or
sale of property in Palmero. All leases shall provide, and if they do not so provide then the
leases shall be deemed to provide, that the Association shall have the right to terminate the lease
upon default by the tenant in observing any of the provisions of this Declaration, the Articles, the
Bylaws, applicable rules and regulations, or of any other agreement, document or instrument
governing the Lots or Homes. The Owner of a leased Home shall be jointly and severally liable
with such Owner's tenant for compliance with the Governing Documents and to the Association
to pay any claim for injury or damage to property caused by the negligence of the tenant. Every
lease shall be subordinate to any lien filed by the Association whether before or after such lease
was entered into.
Within five (5) days following execution of a lease for a Home, but in no event later than
occupancy of the Home by a tenant, Owner shall: (a) notify the Association in writing with the
name of the tenant and all of tenant's family members or others that will be occupying the Home,
and (b) provide the Association with a true, correct and complete copy of the lease agreement.
In the event Owner fails to timely comply with the foregoing, such lease shall be null and void
and of no further force or effect, and Owner shall be in violation of this Declaration.
Section 8.
ANIMALS AND PETS. Only common domesticated household pets may be kept
on any Lot or in a Home, but in no event for the purpose of breeding or for any commercial
purposes whatsoever. No other animals, livestock, horses, reptiles or poultry of any kind shall be
kept, raised, bred or maintained on any portion of the Property. Permitted pets shall only be kept
subject to and in accordance with such rules and regulations as shall be promulgated from time to
time by the Board. Any pet must be carried or kept on a leash when outside of a Home or
fenced-in area. No pet shall be kept tied up outside of a Home or in any screened porch or patio,
unless someone is present in the Home. An Owner shall immediately pick up and remove any
solid animal waste deposited by such Owner's pet on the Property. An Owner is responsible for
the cost of repair or replacement of any Common Area damaged by such Owner's pet.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstances shall a Pit Bull (as hereinafter
defined) and Presa Canario (canary dog), or which has been deemed a "Dangerous dog" pursuant
to Florida Statutes Chapter 767.11 be permitted on the Property. As used in this Declaration: (i)
a "Pit Bull" is defined as any dog that is an American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire
Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, or any dog displaying a majority of the physical traits of any
one (1) or more of the above breeds, or any dog exhibiting those distinguishing characteristics.
Each Owner who determines to keep a pet hereby agrees to indemnify the Association
and Declarant and hold each of the Association and Declarant harmless against any loss or
liability of any kind or character whatsoever arising from or growing out of such Owner having
any animal on the Property.
Section 9. ADDITIONS AND ALTERATIONS. No Home shall be enlarged by any
addition thereto or to any part thereof, and no Owner shall make any Improvement, addition, or
alteration to the exterior of such Owner's Home, including, without limitation, the painting,
48
40756179.8

staining, or varnishing of the exterior of the Home, including doors, garage doors, driveways and
walkways, unless being painted, stained or varnished using the same color as originally installed,
or if replacing the roof, garage door or entry doors using the same color and type as originally
installed, without the prior written approval of: (i) the Committee as set forth in Article VIII of
this Declaration, which approval may be withheld for purely aesthetic reasons, and (ii) all
applicable governmental entities. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no planting,
landscaping and/or Improvements whatsoever shall be installed or constructed in the Lake

(i.e ., areas not visible from the street or any other Lot other than at times of scheduled trash pick-
up), and no odor shall be permitted to arise therefrom so as to render the Property or any portion
thereof unsanitary, offensive, detrimental or a nuisance to Owners or to any other property in the
vicinity thereof or to its occupants. No clothing or other household items shall be hung, dried, or
aired in such a way as to be visible from the Common Area or another Lot. No stripped vehicles,
lumber or other building materials, grass, tree clippings, metals, scrap, automobile pieces or

(except when accumulated during construction by Declarant or when accumulated by the
Association for imminent pick-up and discard).
Section 15. TEMPORARY STRUCTURES. No tent, shack, shed or other temporary building
or Improvement, other than separate construction, service and sales trailers to be used by
Declarant, Declarant's affiliates, and/or their respective agents and contractors, for the

Section 19.
FENCES. Any fence placed upon any Lot must be approved by the Committee,
as provided in Article VIII hereof, prior to installation. In no event may the Committee approve
any request for a fence to be placed in any of the following areas: (i) the area between the front
of a Home and the Roadway at the front of the Lot on which the Home is situated, unless
specifically required by the County Land Development Code; (ii) any drainage easement within
the Property; (iii) any Lake maintenance easement; or (iv) on any Lake Lot. The Owner assumes
complete responsibility to maintain the fence, including, but not limited to, trimming any grass,
ivy or other plants from the fence. In the event the Committee approves the installation of a
fence, it shall also have the right to require installation of landscaping, also subject to the
Committee's approval, at the time the fence is installed. No Owner shall be permitted to attach
50
40756179.8

to any perimeter fence or wall located within any of the Buffers, or to otherwise fence-in or
enclose any portion of a Buffer or other Common Area.
Notwithstanding that an Owner has obtained the approval of the Committee to install a
fence or landscape materials, as provided hereinabove, such installation shall be at the Owner's
sole risk so long as Declarant has not yet begun or is engaged in the construction of a Home on
an adjacent Lot. In the event such construction activity on an adjacent Lot causes damage to or
destruction of such Owner's fence or landscape materials or any part thereof, the Owner on
whose Lot the fence and/or landscaping has been damaged shall be required, at the Owner's
expense, to repair or replace such fence and/or landscape materials in conformance with the
requirements of the Committee's approval of the initial installation of the fence and/or landscape
materials and Declarant shall have no liability for any such damage or destruction. Such repair
or replacement shall commence as soon as construction on the adjacent Lot has been completed
and shall be pursued to completion with due diligence. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
"landscape materials" shall include landscape materials located on or adjacent to any property
line of a Lot, including, by way of example and not of limitation, hedges, shrubs and trees,
whether associated with a fence or not.
In addition, the installation of any fence placed upon any Lot is subject to easements
which run with the land. In the event that any fence is approved by the Committee and is
permitted to cross any such easements, such Committee's approval is still subject to Owner first
receiving written approval from the grantee of such easements and all other applicable
governmental authorities. In the event the grantee of any such easement which runs with the
land (i.e ., utility provider or the County), its successors and/or assigns, requires the removal of
any fence upon the Lot, then the Owner of said Lot shall, at the Owner's sole cost and expense,
immediately remove the fence. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any permit or governmental
approval to the contrary, no fence may be installed within any drainage easement(s) or Lake
maintenance easement on the Property. The Owner of a Lot, when installing any fence upon the
Lot, shall comply with all valid laws, zoning ordinances, codes, rules and regulations of all
applicable governmental bodies, as applicable, in addition to the Committee approval required by
Article VIII hereof.
Invisible fencing may be allowed if approved by the Committee. Any Owner permitted
to install any invisible fencing acknowledges that the Association and the landscape maintenance
company hired by the Association shall not be responsible for any damage caused to such
invisible fencing by the Association's landscape maintenance company. Each Owner who is
permitted to install invisible fencing on such Owner's Lot will be required to sign an
acknowledgment that such Owner shall be responsible for any repairs and/or replacement of the
invisible fencing, even if such repair and/or replacement was caused by the Association's
landscape maintenance company in performing their responsibilities of landscape maintenance.
Section 20. ANTENNAE. No outside television, radio, or other electronic towers, aerials,
antennae, satellite dishes or device of any type for the reception or transmission of radio or
television broadcasts or other means of communication shall hereafter be erected, constructed,
placed or permitted to remain on any portion of the Property or upon any improvements thereon,
unless expressly approved in writing by the Association, except that this prohibition shall not
apply to those satellite dishes that are one (1) meter (39.37 inches) in diameter or less, and
5
40756179.8

specifically covered by 47 C.F.R. Part 1, Subpart S, Section 1.4000, as amended, promulgated
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, as amended from time to time. The Association is
empowered to adopt, and amend from time to time, rules governing the types of antennae which
may be permitted and restrictions relating to safety, location and maintenance of antennae. The
Association may also adopt (and amend from time to time) and enforce reasonable rules limiting
installation of permissible satellite dishes or antennae to certain specified locations, not visible
from the street or neighboring properties, and integrated with the Property and surrounding
landscape, to the extent that reception of an acceptable signal would not be unlawfully impaired
by such rules and provided the cost of complying with such rules would not unreasonably
increase the cost of installation of permissible satellite dishes or antennae. Any permissible
satellite dishes or antennae shall be installed in compliance with all federal, state and local laws
and regulations, including zoning, land-use and building regulations. Further, any Owner
desiring to install permissible satellite dishes or antennae may, but is not obligated to, submit
plans and specifications for same to the Committee to ensure compliance with the Association's
rules governing the types of permissible satellite dishes and antennae and restrictions relating to
safety, location and maintenance of satellite dishes and antennae. This Section 20 shall not apply
to Declarant.
Section 21. IMPROVEMENTS. No Improvements of any kind including, without limitation,
any building, walkways, recreation areas and facilities, parking areas, berms, fountains, sprinkler
systems, gatehouses, streets, drives, roads, driveways, fences, retaining walls, underground

walls, gazebos, benches, mailboxes, topographical feature, landscaping, lawn sculpture, fence,
swimming pool, covered patios, screened enclosure, street lights, decorative street lights and
signs, shall be erected, placed or maintained, and no addition, alteration, modification or change
to any such Improvement shall be made without the prior written approval of the Committee,
including, but not limited to, painting the Home in a color other than the color originally placed
by Declarant on the painted surface, replacing the roof using a different type or color than the
roof originally installed, or replacing a garage door or entry doors using a different color and
type than originally installed.
Section 22. FLAGS. An Owner may display one portable, removable United States flag in a
respectful manner, and one portable, removable official flag in a respectful manner, not larger
than 41/2 feet by 6 feet, that represents the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps,
or Coast Guard, or a POW-MIA flag. Any Owner may erect a freestanding flagpole no more
than 20 feet high on any portion of the Owner's Lot if the flagpole does not obstruct sightlines at
intersections and is not erected within or upon an easement. The Owner may further display in a
respectful manner from that flagpole, one official United States flag, not larger than 41/2 feet by 6
feet, and may additionally display one official flag of the State of Florida or the United States
Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or Coast Guard, or a POW-MIA flag. Such additional flag
must be equal in size to or smaller than the United States flag. The flagpole and display are
subject to all building codes, zoning setbacks, and other applicable governmental regulations,
including, but not limited to, noise and lighting ordinances in the County and all setback and
locational criteria contained in this Declaration.

40756179.8

Section 23. GARAGES. No garage shall be erected which is separate from the Home. No
garage shall be permanently enclosed so as to make such garage unusable by an automobile, and
no portion of a garage originally intended for the parking of an automobile shall be converted
into a living space or storage space and no garage opening shall have a screen covering without
the consent of the Association. All garage doors shall remain closed when vehicles are not
entering or leaving the garage.
Section 24. ENERGY CONSERVATION EQUIPMENT. All solar heating apparatus must
conform to the standards set forth in the HUD Intermediate Minimum Property Standards
Supplement, Solar Heating, and domestic Water Systems. No solar energy collector panels or
attendant hardware or other energy conservation equipment shall be constructed or installed
unless it is an integral and harmonious part of the architectural design of a structure, as
reasonably determined by the Committee. No solar panel, vents, or other roof-mounted,
mechanical equipment shall project more than 1.5 feet above the surface of the roof of a Home;
and all such equipment shall be painted consistent with the color scheme of the roof of the
Home. This provision is not intended to prohibit the use of solar energy devices.
Section 25. HURRICANE SHUTTERS. No hurricane shutters may be installed without the
prior written consent of the Committee, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the installation of hurricane shutters is made which does not conform
to the Committee's consent, then the hurricane shutters will be made to conform by the
Committee at the Owner's expense or they shall be removed. Approved hurricane shutters shall
not be installed or closed, as applicable, before the issuance of a hurricane watch by the National
Hurricane Center encompassing Palmero location, and shall be removed no later than ten (10)
days after the cessation of a hurricane watch or warning for same ("Hurricane Shutter Time
Period").
Each Owner who plans to be absent from his or her Home during the hurricane season
must prepare his or her Lot prior to such Owner's departure by (a) removing all furniture, potted
plants and other movable objects from his or her porch, balcony or patio, if any; (b) designating a
responsible firm or individual satisfactory to the Association to install and remove hurricane
shutters in accordance with the Hurricane Standards and the Hurricane Shutter Time Period
requirements; and (c) designating a responsible firm or individual satisfactory to the Association
to care for the Home should the Home suffer hurricane damage. Such firm or individual shall
contact the Association for clearance to install or remove hurricane shutters pursuant to this
Declaration.
Section 26.
DECLARANT EXEMPTION. Declarant plans to undertake the work of
constructing Homes and Improvements upon the Property and may undertake the work of
constructing other buildings upon adjacent land or other property being developed or marketed
by Declarant or its affiliates. The completion of the aforementioned work and the sale, rental
and other transfer of Homes by Declarant and Declarant's affiliates are essential to the
establishment and welfare of the Property as a residential community. In order that such work
may be completed and a fully occupied community established as rapidly as possible, the
Owners, the Committee and the Association shall not do anything whatsoever to interfere with
any of Declarant's or Declarant's affiliates' activities relating to the selling or constructing of
Homes and Improvements upon the Property, the selling or constructing of other buildings upon
53
40756179.8

adjacent land or any other property being developed or marketed by Declarant or any of
Declarant's affiliates, or the sale, rental and/or other transfer of Homes by Declarant or any of
Declarant's affiliates. In this respect, Declarant hereby reserves the right for itself and its
employees, agents, licensees, and invitees to come upon any and all portions of the Property
(including, without limitation, the Common Area as well as a Lot even after the same has been
conveyed to an Owner) as may be necessary or convenient to enable Declarant to carry on its
work and other activities including, without limitation, Declarant's development and
construction of Palmero and the Homes therein.
In general, the restrictions and limitations set forth in this Article X shall not apply to
Declarant or to Lots owned by Declarant. Declarant shall specifically be exempt from any
restrictions which interfere in any manner whatsoever with Declarant's plans for development,
construction, sale, lease, or use of the Property and to the Improvements thereon. Declarant shall
be entitled to injunctive relief for any actual or threatened interference with its rights under this
Article X in addition to whatever remedies at law to which it might be entitled.
ARTICLE XI
DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION TO COMMON AREA
Damage to or destruction of all or any portion of the Common Area shall,
notwithstanding any provision in this Declaration to the contrary, be handled as follows:
A.
If insurance proceeds are sufficient to effect total restoration of damaged
or destroyed Common Area, then the Association shall cause such Common Area to be repaired
and reconstructed substantially as it previously existed.
B.
If insurance proceeds are insufficient to effect total restoration, and the
cost of restoration exceeds such proceeds by Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000.00) or
less, then the Association shall cause the Common Area to be repaired and reconstructed
substantially as it previously existed and the difference between the insurance proceeds and the
actual cost shall be levied as a Special Assessment proportionately against each of the Lots in
accordance with the provisions of Articles VI and VII herein.
C.
If the insurance proceeds are insufficient to effect total restoration and the
cost of restoration of the Common Area exceeds said proceeds by over Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000.00), then by the written consent or vote of a majority of the voting interests,
they shall determine whether: (i) to rebuild and restore either: (a) in substantially the same
manner as the Improvements existed prior to the damage or destruction; or (b) in a manner less
expensive, and in the event of (a) or (b) to raise the necessary rebuilding and restoration funds by
levying pro rata restoration and construction Special Assessments against all Lots; or (ii) to not
rebuild and to retain available insurance proceeds. In the event it is decided that the damaged or
destroyed Common Area shall not be rebuilt, the remains of any structure or structures shall be
torn down and hauled away, so as not to be a safety hazard or visual nuisance, and the land shall
be fully sodded and landscaped or otherwise treated in an attractive manner. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, any decision not to rebuild or to rebuild in a manner
which would result in a change in the Improvements shall not be effective without the prior
54
40756179.8

written approval of Declarant (which approval shall be given, conditioned or withheld in
Declarant's sole and absolute discretion) as long as Declarant owns any portion of the Property.
D.
Each Owner shall be liable to the Association for any damage to the
Common Area not fully covered or collected by insurance which may be sustained by reason of
the negligence or willful misconduct of said Owner or of such Owner's family, tenants, invitees
and guests, both minors and adults.
E.
In the event that the repairs and replacements were paid for by any Special
Assessments as well as insurance proceeds and regular Assessments, then, if after the completion
of and payment for the repair, replacement, construction or reconstruction there shall remain any
excess in the hands of the Association, it shall be presumed that the monies disbursed in payment
of any repair, replacement, construction and reconstruction were first disbursed from insurance
proceeds and regular Assessments and any remaining funds shall be deemed to be the remaining
Special Assessments which shall be returned to the Owners by means of a pro rata distribution
in accordance with the collection of such Special Assessments.

COMMON STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS. Each Building in Palmero containing
Townhomes shall contain Common Structural Elements ("Common Structural Elements") which

or indirectly in any way service more than one (1) Townhome in the Building.
B.
Party Walls. All division walls ("Party Walls") between two (2) Townhomes
located upon a Lot line between two (2) Townhomes, provided that the mere fact that such a
division wall between two (2) Townhomes is found to be not on a Lot line shall not preclude that
division wall from being a Party Wall. The Owners of the Townhomes adjacent to a Party Wall
shall own such Party Wall as tenants in common. The Owners of the Townhomes sharing Party
Walls shall be jointly responsible for all maintenance, repairs and replacement of the Party Walls
and the Association shall not have any responsibility for the maintenance, repair or replacement
of any Party Wall. No Owner shall make any hole or penetration of any Party Wall. Any Owner
who causes damage to any Party Wall through his or her acts or omissions, or through the acts or
omissions of the Owner's tenants, guests, invitees or members of the Owner's household or
family, shall be liable to the other Owner(s) of the Party Wall for the cost of repairing such
damage and restoring the Townhome and property of the other Owner(s) to the condition they
were in immediately prior to such damage. If the Owner does not repair damages to a Party Wall
that he or she is responsible for within thirty (30) days of the report in writing of such damage,
the Association may cause the damage to be repaired and collect all costs from the responsible
party. The Board may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to assist the Owners of Party
Walls in the peaceful resolution of any disputes concerning the Party Walls through voluntary
binding mediation. If the Board elects to assist by providing voluntary binding mediation for the
Owners of the Party Wall, the Board shall have no liability whatsoever for the outcome of the
mediation, or the failure of any Owner to respect the agreement but will have authority to cause
the repairs to be made and collect all costs from the Owner found to be at fault if he refuses to
make or pay for the repairs. No Association funds shall be expended to provide voluntary
binding mediation services to the Owners of Party Walls, and such Owners shall agree to pay
any expenses incurred for such mediation.
C. Roofing. The entire roof of the Building, any and all roof support structures, and
any and all appurtenances to such roof and roof support structures, including, without limitation,

Association shall only be responsible for the repair or replacement of any Shared Entry Access
Sidewalks and shall not be responsible for the daily type maintenance of any Shared Entry
Access Sidewalks. No Owner shall make any hole or penetration of any Shared Entry Access
Sidewalks or impede another Owner's access to his or her Townhome over any Shared Entry
Access Sidewalks. Any Owner who causes damage to any Shared Entry Access Sidewalks
through his or her acts or omissions, or through the acts or omissions of the Owner's tenants,

Owner(s) of the Shared Entry Access Sidewalks for the cost of repairing such damage and
restoring the Shared Entry Access Sidewalks and property of the other Owner(s) to the condition
they were in immediately prior to such damage.
Should the Common Structural Elements or a part thereof extend beyond the Lot, same
shall not be deemed to violate the provisions of this Declaration and such easements as may be
necessary to accommodate and permit the Common Structural Elements as same shall be
constructed and for the maintenance, repair and replacement thereof, are hereby imposed.
In the event any Common Structural Element or part thereof located within a Townhome
requires non-routine maintenance, repair or replacement and the necessity for such non-routine
maintenance, repair or replacement was not due to any act or failure to act on the part of the
Owner of the Townhome in question, the cost of such non-routine maintenance, repair or
replacement shall be a Special Assessment shared by all Townhome Owners in Palmero.
Routine maintenance, such as repairing cracks in the stucco, is performed by the Association and
the costs and expenses of such routine maintenance shall be part of the Operating Expenses of
the Association and shared by all Townhome Owners in Palmero.
Section 2.
COVENANTS REGARDING TOWNHOMES.
Declarant may construct
Townhomes within Palmero. The restrictions, covenants, and provisions set forth herein shall
apply to such Townhomes, and may be modified, deleted, or supplemented by subsequent
amendment.
A.
Common Walls and Roof. The Townhomes comprising each Building are single
family Townhomes with common walls, known as "party walls," between each Townhome that
adjoins another Townhome. The center line of a party wall is the common boundary of the
adjoining Townhome.
Each common wall in a Townhome shall be a party wall, and any party to said
wall, his or her heirs, successors, and assigns shall have the right to use same jointly with the
other party to said wall as herein set forth. The term "use" shall and does include normal interior
usage such as paneling, plastering, decoration, erection of tangent walls and shelving but
58
40756179.8

----------
prohibits any form of alteration which would cause an aperture, hole, conduit, break or other
displacement of the original concrete or other material forming said party wall.
The cost of maintaining each side of a party wall shall be borne by the Owner
using said side, except as otherwise provided herein.
Owners of Townhomes will be allowed to install screen enclosures on the Party
Wall in the rear yard of the Lot with the Committee's approval. Each Owner must install the
screen enclosure in such a manner that allows for the neighboring Owner to have a screen
enclosure installed and there shall be enough room on the Party Wall for each Owner of the Party
Wall to install a screen enclosure without a shared frame. The installation of the screen
enclosure must provide for, or allow enough room for, the cleaning of debris between the
enclosures, or the screen enclosures shall be designed to prevent debris from getting between the
screen enclosures. Installation of the screen enclosures on the Party Wall must be from the
inside of the screen enclosure (instead of the outside as it is normally with lower floor ground
units). Owners shall be responsible for the cleaning, maintenance, repair and replacement of the
screen enclosure as well as all maintenance, repair and replacement of the Party Wall as it
pertains to such screen enclosure.
The entire roof of the Building, any and all roof structure support, and any and all
appurtenances to such structures, including without limitation, the roof covering, roof trim, and
roof drainage fixtures, shall be collectively referred to as "shared roofing." The Association shall
be responsible for the repair and replacement of the shared roofing and shall collect reserves
from the Townhome Owners for the replacement of the shared roofing.
If a Townhome is damaged through an act of God or other casualty, the affected
Owner shall promptly have his or her Townhome repaired and rebuilt substantially in accordance
with the architectural plans and specifications of the Building. In the event such damage or
destruction of a party wall or shared roofing is caused solely by the neglect or willful misconduct
of an Owner, any expense incidental to the repair or reconstruction of such wall or shared
roofing shall be borne solely by such wrongdoer. If the Owner refuses or fails to pay the cost of
such repair or reconstruction, the Association shall have the right to complete such repair and
reconstruction substantially in accordance with the original plans and specifications of the
affected Building, and the Association shall thereafter have the right to specially assess said
Owner for the costs of such repair and re-construction.
C.
Maintenance of the Exterior of the Townhomes. Each Owner shall at all times be
responsible for the maintenance and care of the exterior surfaces of his or her Townhome. The
phrase "exterior surfaces of the Townhome" shall include, but not be limited to, the exterior
walls and shared roofing. Each Owner shall be responsible for the periodic cleaning of the
exterior walls and shared roofing. The Association shall be responsible for the re-painting of the
exterior walls of the Townhome and shall collect reserves from the Townhome Owners for the
repainting of the Buildings.
No Owner shall authorize the painting, refurbishing or modification of the
exterior surfaces or shared roofing of their Townhome without the consent of the Committee.

If the Owner refuses or fails to maintain the exterior of the Townhome, the
Association shall have the right to complete such maintenance and the Association shall
thereafter have the right to specially assess said Owner for the costs of maintenance. The
Service Area Assessment or Special Assessment incurred to maintain the exterior of the
Townhome(s) by the Association in accordance with this Article will be made pursuant to the
assessment powers and lien rights set forth in the Declaration.

equity, including damages, injunction or any other form of relief against any person, firm or
entity violating or attempting to violate any covenant, restriction or provision hereunder. The
failure by any party to enforce any such covenant, restriction or provision herein contained shall
in no event be deemed a waiver of such covenant, restriction or provision or of the right of such
party to thereafter enforce such covenant, restriction or provision. The prevailing party in any
such litigation shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs thereof including, but not limited to,

Section 6. CERTAIN RIGHTS OF DECLARANT. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein contained, no Improvements constructed or installed by Declarant shall be
subject to the approval of the Association or the Owners or the provisions and requirements of
this Declaration, although it is the intent of Declarant to create a community with a common
scheme of development. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Declaration, Declarant
reserves for itself and its affiliates, Builders and their affiliates, and Declarant, its affiliates and
its nominees, and Builders and their affiliates, shall have, the right to enter into and transact on
the Property any business necessary to consummate the sale, lease or encumbrance of Homes or
real property within or outside Palmero, including, but not limited to, the right to maintain
models and a sales and/or leasing office, a construction office and/or a service office, place signs,
employ sales, leasing, construction and service personnel, use the Common Area and show
Homes, and Declarant further reserves the right to make repairs to the Common Area and to
carry on construction activity for the benefit of the Property. Declarant, its successors and/or
assigns, and Builders and their affiliates shall have access to the Amenity Center and other
facilities at all times during the Development and Sale Period and the Association shall not
impede any such access, and no Owner or the Association shall do any act which may interfere
with Declarant and Builders having access to the Amenity Center and other facilities. Until such
time as Declarant no longer owns any portion of the Property, Declarant shall be allowed to use
the Amenity Center and other facilities for sales meetings and sales related functions and for
other business purposes or functions Declarant determines in its sole discretion. Declarant, its
affiliates and their respective nominees, and Builders and their affiliates may exercise the
foregoing rights without notifying the Association and/or the Owners. Any such models, sales
and/or leasing office, construction office, service office, signs and any other items pertaining to
such sales, leasing, construction or service efforts shall not be considered a part of the Common
Area and shall remain the property of Declarant and/or Builders, as applicable. In addition,
Declarant hereby has, shall have and hereby reserves the right for itself and Builders to enter
upon the Common Area (including, without limitation, all drainage, lake maintenance, and utility
easements, whether located on a Lot or Common Area) in order for Declarant and Builders to
final-out and/or close-out any and all approvals, permits, orders, conditions and/or requirements
that have been issued or imposed by any governmental entity in connection with the
61
40756179.8

development and construction of Palmero and all Improvements therein, and for Declarant and
Builders to comply and adhere to the same, and such rights shall survive the date of Turnover
and continue for such period of time as is necessary for Declarant and Builders to fully comply
with all such governmentally issued approvals, permits, orders, conditions and/or requirements.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in exercising any such rights, Declarant and
Builders shall have the right to remove and/or relocate any and all items (including, without
limitation, landscape materials, fences and/or other Improvements) that may be required to be
removed and/or relocated to final-out and/or close-out any and all such approvals, permits,
orders, conditions and/or requirements without compensation to the Association or the Owners.
This Section 6 may not be suspended, superseded or modified in any manner by any amendment
to this Declaration unless such amendment is consented to in writing by Declarant. This right of
use and transaction of business as set forth herein and the other rights reserved by Declarant in
the Governing Documents may be assigned in writing by Declarant in whole or in part. For the
purposes of this Section 6, the term "Declarant" shall include any "Lender" which has loaned
money to Declarant or a Builder to acquire or construct Improvements upon the Property, or its
successors and assigns if such Lender, its successors or assigns, acquires title to any portion of
the Property as a result of the foreclosure of any mortgage encumbering any portion of the
Property securing any such loan to Declarant, or acquires title thereto by deed in lieu of
foreclosure. The rights and privileges of Declarant as set forth in this Section 6 are in addition to,
and are no way a limit on, any other rights or privileges of Declarant under any of the Governing
Documents.
Declarant shall also have the right, but not the obligation, to conduct inspections
and tests from time to time of all or any portion of the Common Area in order to ascertain the
physical condition of the Improvements and to determine if maintenance, repair or replacement
of any such Improvement is necessary. If Declarant conducts any such tests or inspections, it
shall pay all costs thereof and restore the affected portion of the Property to its condition
immediately prior to the inspections and tests. Declarant shall have such rights of entry on, over,
under, across and through the Property as may be reasonably necessary to exercise the rights
described in this Section 6. Declarant's right of inspection shall exist whether or not the
Turnover Date has occurred. In the event Declarant exercises its inspection right, it is
acknowledged by the Association and all Owners that Declarant is performing any such
inspection for its own benefit and not for the benefit of the Association and/or the Owners and
further, Declarant shall have no obligation to inform the Association and/or the Owners of the
result of any such inspection.

thereof and interest therein, and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of Declarant and subsequent Owner(s) of the Homes, Lots and Property or any part
thereof, or interest therein, and their respective heirs, successors, and assigns. However, the
same are not intended to create nor shall they be construed as creating any rights in or for the
benefit of the general public, unless specifically provided herein to the contrary. All present and
future Owners, tenants, and occupants of the Lots and Homes, as applicable, shall be subject to

by reason of having acquired ownership of a Lot, whether by purchase, gift, operation of law or

to have acknowledged and agreed to his or her automatic consent to any rezoning, replatting,
covenant in lieu of unity of title, change, addition or deletion made in, on or to Palmero by
Declarant (hereinafter, collectively, the "Modifications") and, in respect thereto, each Owner of a
Lot and occupant of a Home hereby designates the Association to act as agent and attorney in
fact on behalf of such Owner or occupant to consent to any such Modification. If requested by
Declarant, each Owner shall evidence his or her consent to a Modification in writing (provided,
however, that any refusal to give such written consent shall not obviate the automatic effect of
68
40756179.8

this provision). Further, each Owner, by reason of having acquired ownership of a Lot, hereby
agrees to execute, at the request of Declarant, any document and/or consent which may be
required by any government agency to allow Declarant and/or its affiliates to complete the plan
of development of Palmero, as such plan may be hereafter amended, and each such Owner
hereby further appoints Declarant as such Owner's agent and attorney-in-fact to execute, on
behalf and in the name of each such Owner, any and all of such documents and/or consents. This
power of attorney is irrevocable and is coupled with an interest. The provisions of this Section
19 may not be amended without Declarant's prior written consent.
Section 19. DECLARANT'S RESERVATION OF RIGHTS. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein or in any of the other Governing Documents to the contrary, Declarant reserves

be other than single-family residential (e.g ., multi-family residential or commercial) and/or to
make such uses of all or any part of the Property as shall be permitted by applicable zoning
regulations as they may exist from time to time. Declarant, however, is not obligated by this
Declaration to cause any portion of the Property to be rezoned or developed for any such uses.
In the event Declarant changes the zoning of the Property, Declarant hereby reserves the right to
amend this Declaration or to create one or more sub-association declarations subjecting such
property(ies) to additional or different specified or prohibited uses.

Notification. The Association and all Owners agree to

Owner agree to provide Declarant and its representatives, contractors, and others as
Declarant may request, with prompt, reasonable cooperation, which may, for
example, include access to all portions of the Property, in order to facilitate
Declarant's investigation regarding a Dispute including, without limitation, for
purposes of inspecting, testing, repairing, replacing, correcting, or otherwise
addressing matters related to the Dispute. If the Dispute arises out of or relates to
the planning, surveying, design, engineering, grading, specifications, construction,
or other development of the Property, Declarant is hereby granted the irrevocable
right, but is under no obligation, to inspect, repair and/or replace any and all
affected parts of the Property.
NOTICE: THE BOUND PARTIES AGREE TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE ARISING
OUT OF THE MATTERS INCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (ARTICLE
XV, SECTION 20 OF THIS DECLARATION) ENTITLED, "DISPUTE RESOLUTION -
ARBITRATION" DECIDED BY NEUTRAL ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, AND THE BOUND PARTIES ARE GIVING UP ANY
RIGHTS THE BOUND PARTIES MIGHT POSSESS TO HAVE THE DISPUTE LITIGATED
IN A COURT OR JURY TRIAL. THE BOUND PARTIES ARE GIVING UP THEIR
RESPECTIVE JUDICIAL RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL, UNLESS THOSE
RIGHTS ARE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IN THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. IF
ANY OWNER OR DECLARANT AND/OR THE ASSOCIATION REFUSE TO SUBMIT TO
ARBITRATION AFTER AGREEING TO THIS PROVISION, THE OWNER OR
DECLARANT AND/OR THE ASSOCIATION MAY BE COMPELLED TO ARBITRATE
UNDER THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. THE BOUND PARTIES' AGREEMENT TO
THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION IS VOLUNTARY.
THIS DECLARATION PROVIDES THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE BOUND
PARTIES WILL BE RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PROVISIONS SET FORTH ABOVE. THIS MEANS THAT THE BOUND PARTIES EACH
GIVE UP THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT OR TO A JURY TO ASSERT OR DEFEND
RIGHTS UNDER THIS DECLARATION. THE BOUND PARTIES RIGHTS WILL BE
DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. THE
BOUND PARTIES ARE ENTITLED TO A FAIR HEARING, BUT THE ARBITRATION
PROCEDURES ARE SIMPLER AND MORE LIMITED THAN THE RULES FOLLOWED IN
A COURT. ARBITRATOR DECISIONS ARE AS ENFORCEABLE AS ANY COURT
ORDER AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.
73
40756179.8

"Class A Members" shall be the Owners of Single-Family Lots in
Palmero, with the exception of Declarant while Declarant is a "Class C Member", each of whom

entitled to vote on matters exclusively concerning the Single Family Lots.
2.
"Class B Members" shall be the Owners of Townhome Units in Palmero,
with the exception of Declarant while Declarant is a "Class C Member", each of whom shall be
entitled to one (1) vote for each Lot owned. Only "Class B Members" are entitled to vote on
matters exclusively concerning the Townhome Units.
3.
"Class C Member" shall be Declarant, who shall be entitled to three times

(e)
upon a receiver for the "Class C Member" being appointed by a
circuit court and not being discharged within thirty (30) days after such

Members; or
(f) at such time as Declarant shall designate in writing to the
Association.

(((H21000028739 3)))
On the Turnover Date, "Class A Members" and "Class B Members," including
Declarant, shall assume control of the Association and elect not less than a majority of the Board.
Beginning at the Turnover Date and thereafter, the "Class A Members" shall elect three (3)
Directors and the "Class B Members" shall elect two (2) Directors.
Members other than Declarant are entitled to elect at least one (1) member of the
Board when fifty percent (50%) of the Homes in all phases of Palmero which will ultimately be
operated by the Association have been conveyed to Members other than Declarant.
E.
The designation of different classes of Membership are for purposes of
establishing the number of votes applicable to certain Lots, and nothing herein shall be deemed
to require voting solely by an individual class on any matter which requires the vote of Members,
unless otherwise specifically set forth in the Governing Documents.
F.
No Member may assign, hypothecate or transfer in any manner his or her
Membership in the Association except as an appurtenance to his or her Lot.
G. Any Member who conveys or loses title to a Lot by sale, gift, devise, bequest,
judicial decree or otherwise shall, immediately upon such conveyance or loss of title, no longer
be a Member with respect to such Lot and shall lose all rights and privileges of a Member
resulting from ownership of such Lot.
H.
There shall be only one (1) vote for each Lot, except for the "Class C Member" as
set forth herein. If there is more than one (1) Member with respect to a Lot as a result of the fee
interest in such Lot being held by more than one (1) person, such Members collectively shall be
entitled to only one (1) vote. The vote of the Owners of a Lot owned by more than one (1)
natural person or by a corporation or other legal entity shall be cast by the person named in a
voting certificate signed by all of the Owners of the Lot, or, if appropriate, by properly
designated officers, partners or principals of the respective legal entity (the "Voting Member")
and filed with the Secretary of the Association, and such voting certificate shall be valid until
revoked by a subsequent voting certificate. If such a voting certificate is not filed with the
Secretary of the Association, the vote of such Lot shall not be considered for a quorum or for any
other purpose.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, whenever any Lot is owned by a
husband and wife they may, but shall not be required to, designate a Voting Member. In the
event a voting certificate designating a Voting Member is not filed by the husband and wife, the
following provisions shall govern their right to vote:
1.
When both are present at a meeting, each shall be regarded as the agent
and proxy of the other for purposes of casting the vote for each Lot owned by them. In the event
they are unable to concur in their decision upon any topic requiring a vote, they shall lose their
right to vote on that topic at that meeting, but shall count for purposes of establishing a quorum.
2.
When only one (1) spouse is present at a meeting, the person present may
cast the Lot vote without establishing the concurrence of the other spouse, absent any prior
written notice to the contrary by the other spouse. In the event of prior written notice to the
8
40756339.3
(((H21000028739 3)))

(((H21000028739 3)))
contrary to the Association by the other spouse, the vote of said Lot shall not be considered, but
shall count for purposes of establishing a quorum.
3.
When neither spouse is present, the person designated in a "Proxy" (as
defined in the Bylaws) signed by either spouse may cast the Lot vote, when voting by Proxy is
allowed, absent any prior written notice to the contrary to the Association by the other spouse or
the designation of a different Proxy by the other spouse. In the event of prior written notice to
the contrary to the Association or the designation of a different Proxy by the other spouse, the
vote of said Lot shall not be considered, but shall count for purposes of establishing a quorum.
I.
A quorum shall consist of persons entitled to cast at least twenty percent (20%) of
the total number of votes of the Members.
ARTICLE VI

(((H21000028739 3)))
Developed Homes"). For purposes of this paragraph, "Total Developed Homes" shall mean the

D

elect not less than a majority of the Board. The election of not less than a majority of the Board
by the Purchaser Members shall occur at a special meeting of the Membership to be called by the
Board for such purpose ("Initial Election Meeting"). The First Board shall serve until the Initial

E.
The Initial Election Meeting shall be called by the Association, through the

Directors as provided in Paragraph D hereof. A notice of meeting shall be forwarded to all
Members in accordance with the Bylaws; provided, however, that the Members shall be given at
least fourteen (14) days' notice of such meeting. The notice shall also specify the number of

F.
At the Initial Election Meeting, the Class A Members shall elect three (3) of the

exercises its right until the Declarant's Resignation Event to designate one (1) Director, in which
case the Class A Members shall only elect two (2) Directors and (same constituting the "Initial

H.
A Director (other than a Declarant-appointed Director) may be removed from
office upon the affirmative vote or the agreement in writing of a majority of the voting interests
of Members for any reason deemed to be in the best interests of the Members. A meeting of the
Purchaser Members to so remove a Director (other than a Declarant-appointed Director) shall be
held upon the written request of ten percent (10%) of the Members. Any such recall shall be
effected and a recall election shall be held, if applicable, as provided in the HOA Act.

Developed Homes for sale in the ordinary course of business and all Lots sold by Declarant have
been conveyed as evidenced by the recording of instruments of conveyance of such Lots
amongst the Public Records of the County; or
2 .
When Declarant causes the voluntary resignation of all of the Directors
designated by Declarant and does not designate replacement Directors.
Upon Declarant's Resignation Event, the Directors elected by Purchaser Members
shall elect a successor Director to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation or removal of
Declarant's designated Director. This successor Director shall serve until the next Annual
Members' Meeting and until his successor is elected and qualified. In the event Declarant's
Resignation Event occurs prior to the Initial Election Meeting, the Initial Election Meeting shall
be called in the manner set forth in Paragraph E of this Article X, and all of the Directors shall be
elected by the Purchaser Members at such meeting.
J.
At each Annual Members' Meeting held subsequent to Declarant's Resignation
Event, three (3) of the Directors shall be elected by the Class A Members and two (2) of the
Directors shall be elected by the Class B Members. At the first Annual Members Meeting held
after Declarant's Resignation Event, a "staggered" term of office of the Board shall be created as
follows:
1.
a number equal to fifty percent (50%) of the total number of Directors
rounded to the nearest whole number is the number of Directors whose term of office shall be
established at two (2) years and the Directors serving for a two (2) year term will be the
Directors receiving the most votes at the meeting; and
2.
the remaining Directors' terms of office shall be established at one (1)
year.
At each Annual Members' Meeting thereafter, as many Directors of the
Association shall be elected as there are Directors whose regular term of office expires at such
time, and the term of office of the Directors so elected shall be for two (2) years, expiring when
their successors are duly elected and qualified.
K.
The resignation of a Director who has been designated by Declarant or the
resignation of an officer of the Association who has been elected by the First Board shall be
deemed to remise, release, acquit, satisfy and forever discharge such officer or Director of and
from any and all manner of action(s), cause(s) of action, suits, debts, dues, sums of money,
accounts, reckonings, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies, agreements,
promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, executions, claims and demands
whatsoever, in law or in equity, which the Association or Purchaser Members had, now have or
will have or which any personal representative, successor, heir or assign of the Association or
Purchaser Members hereafter can, shall or may have against said officer or Director for, upon or
12

Exhibit "C," Page 1 of 11
40756253.3

Vice President upon receipt of a written request from Members having the right to vote at least
one-third (1/3) of the total number of votes entitled to be cast by Members at any such special
meeting, except as provided for recall of Directors in Article X, Section G of the Articles.
3.4. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles, a written notice of each Members'
meeting, whether an Annual Members' Meeting or a special meeting (collectively "Meeting"),
shall be given to each Member entitled to vote thereat at the address of the Home owned by such
Owner, or such other address as the Owner shall notify the Association of in writing and shall be

3.5. The Members may, at the discretion of the Board, act by written response in lieu
of a Meeting provided written notice of the matter or matters to be agreed upon is given to the
Members or duly waived in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws. Unless some
greater number is required under the Governing Documents and except as to the election of
Directors, which shall be accomplished by plurality vote, the decision of a majority of the votes
cast by Members as to the matter or matters to be agreed or voted upon shall be binding on the
Members provided a quorum is either present at such Meeting or submits a response if action is
taken by written response in lieu of a Meeting, as the case may be. The notice with respect to
actions to be taken by written response in lieu of a Meeting shall set forth the time period during
which the written responses must be received by the Association.

Paragraph 3.10) may be used to establish a quorum.
(b) When a quorum is present at any Meeting and a question which raises the
jurisdiction of such Meeting is presented, the holders of a majority of the voting rights present in
person or represented by written Proxy shall be required to decide the question. However, if the
question is one upon which a vote other than the majority vote of a quorum is required by
express provision of the Governing Documents or by law, then such express provision shall
govern and control the required vote on the decision of such question.
3.7. At any Annual Members' Meeting when elections of Directors are to occur,
written ballots are to be supplied to Members for such purposes. The Board shall adopt a
procedure to be followed for each election, which procedure shall specify if nominations for
Directors shall be submitted before the meeting so that absentee ballots may be used or if
Exhibit "C," Page 2 of 11
40756253.3

----------
nominations for Directors will be taken at the Meeting and in which case absentee ballots may
not be used. Members may not vote for Directors by Proxy but Proxies may be used to establish
a quorum. Furthermore, at any Annual Members' Meeting at which Directors are to be elected,
the "Chairman" (as hereinafter defined in Paragraph 7.2) shall appoint an "Election Committee"
consisting of three (3) Members to supervise the election, count and verify ballots, disqualify
votes if such disqualification is justified under the circumstances and certify the results of the
election to the Board. The Election Committee shall be able to determine questions within its
jurisdiction by plurality vote of all three (3) members, but matters resulting in deadlocked votes
of the Election Committee shall be referred to the entire Board for resolution.
3.8. If a quorum is not in attendance at a Meeting, the Members who are present,
either in person or by Proxy, may adjourn the Meeting from time to time until a quorum is
present with no further notice of such adjourned Meeting being required unless otherwise
determined by the Board.
3.9. Minutes of all Meetings shall be kept in a businesslike manner and be available
for inspection by the Members and Directors at all reasonable times. The Association shall
retain minutes for at least seven (7) years subsequent to the date of the meeting the minutes
reflect.
3.10. Voting rights of Members shall be as stated in the Articles with respect to the
election of all Boards other than the First Board. Such votes may be cast in person or by Proxy
(except for the election of Directors). Proxies may be used to vote on other agenda items at
meetings at which Directors are to be elected, and may also be used to establish a quorum.
"Proxy" is defined to mean an instrument containing the appointment of a person who is
substituted in the place and stead of the person or authorized representative of an entity entitled
to vote. Proxies shall be in writing signed by the person or authorized representative of an entity
giving the same and shall be valid only for the particular Meeting designated therein and, if so
stated in the Proxy, any adjournments thereof, provided, however, any proxy automatically
expires ninety (90) days after the date of the meeting for which it was originally given. A Proxy
must be filed with the Secretary of the Association before the appointed time of the Meeting in
order to be valid. Any Proxy may be revoked prior to the time a vote is cast in accordance with
such Proxy.
Section 4. Board; Directors' Meetings
4.1. The business and administration of the Association shall be by its Board.
4.2. The election and, if applicable, designation of Directors shall be conducted in
accordance with the Articles. Except for Declarant-appointed Directors, Directors must be
Members or the parents, children or spouses of Members except that if a Lot is owned by an
entity and not an individual, such entity may only appoint a partner, shareholder, member,
manager, director or officer of such entity or any of its constituent entities on its behalf to be
eligible to serve on the Board.

Member from the meeting by any reasonable means which may be necessary to accomplish said
Member's expulsion. Also, any Director shall have the right to exclude from any meeting of the
Board any person who is not able to provide sufficient proof that he/she is a Member or a duly
authorized representative, agent or proxy holder of a Member, unless said person has been
specifically invited by any of the Directors to participate in such meeting.
4.14. Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Directors may be
taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, specifically setting forth the action to be taken,
shall be signed by all the Directors entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof and
such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the Directors, provided,
however, whenever assessments are to be considered, they may be considered only at a meeting
of the Directors properly noticed in accordance with the HOA Act.

Budget applies. Prior to the Budget Meeting, a proposed Budget for the Operating Expenses

regardless of when the bill for such expenses is received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

calendar year as such expenses are incurred in accordance with the accrual basis method of
accounting.

shall be payable as provided in the Declaration.

Special Assessment or an upward adjustment to the Individual Lot Assessment.
9.6. The depository of the Association shall be such bank or banks as shall be
designated from time to time by the Board in which the monies of the Association shall be

Mitigation Comments:
Wetland mitigation for the 0.02 acre of permanent filling impacts to freshwater marsh and the 1.47 acres of
permanent filling impacts to wet prairies will be provided by the on-site enhancement of freshwater marsh (Wetlands
B, D, and G) and the on-site enhancement of willow and elderberry (Wetlands E and H). The result of the Uniform
Mitigation Assessment Method (UMAM) analysis indicates a functional gain of 0.65 freshwater herbaceous units which
offsets the functional loss of 0.64 freshwater herbaceous units. The UMAM analysis resulted in an excess of 0.01
freshwater herbaceous functional gain units which may be reserved for future withdrawal by Taylor Morrison of
Florida, Inc. within the Southern Coastal Drainage Basin.
Wetland mitigation is not required for the 0.15 acre of temporary dredging impacts to freshwater marsh (Wetlands A,
B, D, and G), 0.01 acre of temporary dredging impacts to wetland forested mixed (Wetland C), and 0.01 acre of
temporary dredging impacts to willow and elderberry (Wetland E) pursuant to Subsection 10.2.2 of the A.H.V.I. Under
this subsection, wetland mitigation is not required for impacts that have been determined to be de minimis to fish,
wildlife, and listed species.

a.
All activities shall be implemented following the plans, specifications and performance criteria approved by
this permit. Any deviations must be authorized in a permit modification in accordance with Rule 62-330.315,
F.A.C ., or the permit may be revoked and the permittee may be subject to enforcement action.
b.

vested in the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, the permittee must receive all
necessary approvals and authorizations under Chapters 253 and 258, F.S. Written authorization that
requires formal execution by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund shall not be
considered received until it has been fully executed.
k.
The permittee shall hold and save the Agency harmless from any and all damages, claims, or liabilities that
may arise by reason of the construction, alteration, operation, maintenance, removal, abandonment or use of
any project authorized by the permit.
The permittee shall notify the Agency in writing:
1. Immediately if any previously submitted information is discovered to be inaccurate; and
2. Within 30 days of any conveyance or division of ownership or control of the property or the system, other
than conveyance via a long-term lease, and the new owner shall request transfer of the permit in
accordance with Rule 62-330.340, F.A.C. This does not apply to the sale of lots or units in residential or
commercial subdivisions or condominiums where the stormwater management system has been
completed and converted to the operation phase.
m.
Upon reasonable notice to the permittee, Agency staff with proper identification shall have permission to
enter, inspect, sample and test the project or activities to ensure conformity with the
plans and specifications authorized in the permit.
n. If any prehistoric or historic artifacts, such as pottery or ceramics, stone tools or metal implements, dugout
canoes, or any other physical remains that could be associated with Native American cultures, or early
colonial or American settlement are encountered at any time within the project site area, work involving
14

subsurface disturbance in the immediate vicinity of such discoveries shall cease. The permittee or other
designee shall contact the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, Compliance and
Review Section, at (850) 245-6333 or (800) 847-7278, as well as the appropriate permitting agency office.
Such subsurface work shall not resume without verbal or written authorization from the Division of Historical
Resources. If unmarked human remains are encountered, all work shall stop immediately and notification
shall be provided in accordance with Section 872.05, F.S. (2012).
0.
Any delineation of the extent of a wetland or other surface water submitted as part of the permit application,
including plans or other supporting documentation, shall not be considered binding unless a specific
condition of this permit or a formal determination under Rule 62-330.201, F.A.C ., provides otherwise.
p.
The permittee shall provide routine maintenance of all components of the stormwater management system to
remove trapped sediments and debris. Removed materials shall be disposed of in a landfill or other uplands
in a manner that does not require a permit under Chapter 62-330, F.A.C ., or cause violations of state water
quality standards.
q.
This permit is issued based on the applicant's submitted information that reasonably demonstrates that
adverse water resource-related impacts will not be caused by the completed permit activity. If any adverse
impacts result, the Agency will require the permittee to eliminate the cause, obtain any necessary permit
modification, and take any necessary corrective actions to resolve the adverse impacts.
r.
A Recorded Notice of Environmental Resource Permit may be recorded in the county public records in
accordance with Rule 62-330.090(7), F.A.C. Such notice is not an encumbrance upon the property.
2.
In addition to those general conditions in subsection (1) above, the Agency shall impose any additional project-
specific special conditions necessary to assure the permitted activities will not be harmful to the water resources,
as set forth in Rules 62-330.301 and 62-330.302, F.A.C ., Volumes I and II, as applicable, and the rules
incorporated by reference in this chapter.

WHEREAS, Declarant recorded that certain Declaration of Covenants, Conditions,
Restrictions and Easements for Palmero on April 19, 2021, in Official Records Instrument
#2021070682, of the Public Records of Sarasota County, Florida (the "Declaration"); and

requirement of the Association's consent or the consent of the Owners so long as such amendments
or modifications do not materially impair the common plan of development of Palmero; and
WHEREAS, the Turnover Date has not occurred as of the date of this First Amendment; and
WHEREAS, the amendment contained herein does not materially impair the common plan of

Subsection E of Section 6 of Article IV of the Declaration is hereby amended to read
as follows:
E.
Drainage Easement. An easement over, under and upon all of
the Property for the Surface Water Management System and access to install,
operate, maintain, alter, inspect, remove, relocate, repair and/or replace the
Surface Water Management System. By this easement, the Association shall
have the right to enter upon any portion of a Lot which is part of the Surface
Water Management System, at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner,
to operate, maintain and repair the Surface Water Management System as
required by the Water Management District or the County. No Owner shall
install any plantings, landscaping, fences and/or other Improvements
whatsoever in, on, over or across any drainage easement, without the
express written consent of the Committee.
4.
Section 6 of Article VI of the Declaration is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 6.
BUDGETING FOR RESERVES. The Board may, but is not
obligated to, prepare and periodically review separate reserve budgets for the
Common Area for which the Association maintains capital items which takes
into account the number and nature of replaceable completed assets, the
expected life of each completed asset, and the expected repair or replacement
cost of capital items under each reserve budget. The Board may include in the
Operating Expense Budget adopted pursuant to Section 1, as appropriate, a
contribution to fund reserves in an amount which the Board, in the exercise
of its business judgment, deems sufficient to meet the projected needs under
each reserve budget with respect to both amount and timing by annual
contributions over the budget period. The budgeted amount for reserves need
not be for one hundred percent (100%) of the repair or replacement cost but
may be for a lower amount as determined by the Board. The Board may
determine to pool reserves, meaning that a general reserve fund may be used
for any item for which reserves are being collected. Completed Lot Owners
are referred to the then current Budget to determine if reserves are included
in the Budget, the amount budgeted therefor and if Assessments include
amounts for reserves.
Reserve funds, if collected, shall be held in a separate account or
accounts from the operating and other funds of the Association.
The reserve funds may be expended only for major maintenance,
repair, or replacement of those assets covered by the reserve budget pursuant
to which they were collected. Subject to such limitation, the Board may adopt
resolutions regarding the expenditure of any reserve funds including, without
limitation, policies designating the nature of assets for which reserve funds
may be expended. Neither the Association membership nor the Board shall
2
46569561v3

DocuSign Envelope ID: E3D1891A-FCA7-4785-8A55-108471F88424
adopt, modify, limit, or expand such policies without Declarant's prior
written consent during the Development and Sale Period.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6, or as may be
otherwise set forth in this Declaration, any reserve funds so collected and/or
paid pursuant hereto are not created or established in accordance with Section
720.303(6)(d) of the HOA ACT.
In lieu of establishing a reserve fund the Board may establish a
contingency fund. Such contingency fund is not a reserve fund under
Section 720.303(6) of the HOA Act and may be used by the Board as it
determines in its discretion and business judgement.
5.
Section 8 of Article VI of the Declaration is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 8.
DECLARANT'S OPTION TO FUND BUDGET DEFICITS.
To the extent permitted by Florida law, until the end of the Development and
Sale Period, Declarant may satisfy the obligation for Assessments on Lots
which it owns either by paying Assessments in the same manner as any other
Owner (but at the 20:1 ratio described above) or by funding the budget
Deficit. The budget deficit ("Deficit") is the difference between (i) the
amount of Assessments levied on Owners' Lots plus any other income,
revenue or sums received by the Association during the period during which
Declarant has elected to fund the Deficit, and (ii) the amount of the
Association's actual expenditures during the fiscal year and excluding to the
maximum extent allowable by law, contributions to reserves, if any, and
Special Assessments arising as a result of any unusual loss or liability. The
calculation of Declarant's Deficit funding obligation shall be done on a
cumulative basis (from the inception of the election to fund the Deficit until
Declarant's election to cease funding the Deficit) although Declarant will
fund the Association to meet its cash flow obligations as they arise during the
Deficit funding period. Should Declarant, in its sole discretion, elect to fund
cash shortfalls caused by delinquencies or other matters which would not
otherwise require deficit funds from Declarant, such funds shall be
considered a loan to the Association to be paid back to Declarant by the
Association. To the maximum extent allowable by law Declarant is not
required to make contributions to reserves while Deficit funding even though
Owners other than Declarant may be required to make such contributions.
Unless Declarant otherwise notifies the Board in writing, Declarant
shall continue paying on the same basis as during the previous fiscal year.
Regardless of Declarant's election, Declarant's Assessment obligations may
be satisfied in the form of cash or by "in kind" contributions of services or
materials, or by a combination of these, the value of which shall be
reasonably determined by Declarant. After the end of the Development and
Sale Period, or sooner if Declarant elects to pay Assessments and cease
3
46569561v3

DocuSign Envelope ID: E3D1891A-FCA7-4785-8A55-108471F88424
Deficit funding, Declarant shall pay Assessments on Lots which it or its
affiliates own in the same manner as any other Owner.
Declarant's obligation to Deficit fund is not a guarantee of the
Assessments or Operating Expenses as contemplated by Florida Statutes
Section 720.308 because the amount of Assessments or Operating Expenses
to be paid by Owners during any Deficit funding period may change based
upon changes in the then buildout Budget.
6.
Section 10 of Article VI of the Declaration is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 10.
WORKING FUNDRESALE CONTRIBUTION, Each
subsequent Owner of a Lot (meaning any Owner who purchases a Lot from a
previous Owner other than Declarant or a Builder) shall pay to the
Association a Working FundResale Contribution at the time legal title is
conveyed to such Owner by the previous Owner. The Working FundResale
Contribution shall be Two Thousand Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars
($2,500.00) for each Lot and each subsequent conveyance of the Lot. The
Resale Contribution shall be paid to the Association by separate check
upon the closing or other settlement of the transfer or conveyance of the
Lot. Any unpaid Resale Contribution constitutes a lien in favor of the
Association against the Home as provided in Section of Article VI of this
Declaration. The amount of the Resale Contribution is subject to change
in the Board's sole discretion. In the event an Institutional Mortgagee
acquires title through foreclosure or a deed in lieu, the Institutional
Mortgagee shall be exempt from paying such Working FundResale
Contribution. The purpose of the Working FundResale Contribution is to
ensure that the Association will have cash available for initial start-up
expenses, to meet unforeseen expenditures and to acquire additional
equipment and services deemed necessary or desirable by the Board.
Working FundResale Contributions are not advance payments of Individual
Lot Assessments and shall have no effect on future Individual Lot
Assessments, nor will they be held in reserve. Working Fund Resale
Contributions may also be used to offset Operating Expenses and fund any
deficit between yearly Operating Expenses and income collected from
Assessments. Declarant may, in its sole discretion, move any Working
Fund Resale Contributions not used for Operating Expenses into a reserve
account prior to or at the time of the Turnover Date.
7.
Section 19 of Article X of the Declaration is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 19. FENCES.
Any fence placed upon any Lot must be
approved by the Committee, as provided in Article VIII hereof, prior to
installation. In no event may the Committee approve any request for a fence
to be placed in any of the following areas: (i) the area between the front of a
Home and the Roadway at the front of the Lot on which the Home is situated,
4
46569561v3

DocuSign Envelope ID: E3D1891A-FCA7-4785-8A55-108471F88424
unless specifically required by the County Land Development Code; (ii) any
drainage easement within the Property; (iii) any Lake maintenance
easement; or (iiiv) on any Lake Lot. The Owner assumes complete
responsibility to maintain the fence, including, but not limited to, trimming
any grass, ivy or other plants from the fence. In the event the Committee
approves the installation of a fence, it shall also have the right to require
installation of landscaping, also subject to the Committee's approval, at the
time the fence is installed. No Owner shall be permitted to attach to any
perimeter fence or wall located within any of the Buffers, or to otherwise
fence-in or enclose any portion of a Buffer or other Common Area.
Notwithstanding that an Owner has obtained the approval of the
Committee to install a fence or landscape materials, as provided hereinabove,
such installation shall be at the Owner's sole risk so long as Declarant has not
yet begun or is engaged in the construction of a Home on an adjacent Lot. In
the event such construction activity on an adjacent Lot causes damage to or
destruction of such Owner's fence or landscape materials or any part thereof,
the Owner on whose Lot the fence and/or landscaping has been damaged
shall be required, at the Owner's expense, to repair or replace such fence
and/or landscape materials in conformance with the requirements of the
Committee's approval of the initial installation of the fence and/or landscape
materials and Declarant shall have no liability for any such damage or
destruction. Such repair or replacement shall commence as soon as
construction on the adjacent Lot has been completed and shall be pursued to
completion with due diligence. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
"landscape materials" shall include landscape materials located on or
adjacent to any property line of a Lot, including, by way of example and not
of limitation, hedges, shrubs and trees, whether associated with a fence or
not
In addition, the installation of any fence placed upon any Lot is
subject to easements which run with the land. In the event that any fence is
approved by the Committee and is permitted to cross any such easements,
such Committee's approval is still subject to Owner first receiving written
approval from the grantee of such easements and all other applicable
governmental authorities. In the event the grantee of any such easement
which runs with the land (i.e ., utility provider or the County), its successors
and/or assigns, requires the removal of any fence upon the Lot, then the
Owner of said Lot shall, at the Owner's sole cost and expense, immediately
remove the fence. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any permit or
governmental approval to the contrary, no fence may be installed within any
drainage easement(s) by any Owner, other than Declarant, without the
Committee's approval, or Lake maintenance easement on the Property. The
Owner of a Lot, when installing any fence upon the Lot, shall comply with all
valid laws, zoning ordinances, codes, rules and regulations of all applicable
5
46569561v3

DocuSign Envelope ID: E3D1891A-FCA7-4785-8A55-108471F88424
governmental bodies, as applicable, in addition to the Committee approval
required by Article VIII hereof.
Invisible fencing may be allowed if approved by the Committee. Any
Owner permitted to install any invisible fencing acknowledges that the
Association and the landscape maintenance company hired by the
Association shall not be responsible for any damage caused to such invisible
fencing by the Association's landscape maintenance company. Each Owner
who is permitted to install invisible fencing on such Owner's Lot will be
required to sign an acknowledgment that such Owner shall be responsible for
any repairs and/or replacement of the invisible fencing, even if such repair
and/or replacement was caused by the Association's landscape maintenance
company in performing their responsibilities of landscape maintenance.
(Words struck through are deleted; words bolded and double-underlined are added

Section 19 of Article X of the Declaration is hereby amended to read as follows:
Section 19. FENCES.
Any fence placed upon any Lot must be
approved by the Committee, as provided in Article VIII hereof, prior to
installation. In no event may the Committee approve any request for a fence
to be placed in any of the following areas: (i) the area between the front of a
Home and the Roadway at the front of the Lot on which the Home is situated,
unless specifically required by the County Land Development Code; or (ii)
any Lake maintenance easement ,; or (iii) en any Fences may only be
installed on a Lake Lot with the prior express written consent of the
Committee, The Owner assumes complete responsibility to maintain the
fence, including, but not limited to, trimming any grass, ivy or other plants
from the fence. In the event the Committee approves the installation of a
fence, it shall also have the right to require installation of landscaping, also
subject to the Committee's approval, at the time the fence is installed. No
Owner shall be permitted to attach to any perimeter fence or wall located
within any of the Buffers, or to otherwise fence-in or enclose any portion of a
Buffer or other Common Area.
Notwithstanding that an Owner has obtained the approval of the
Committee to install a fence or landscape materials, as provided hereinabove,
such installation shall be at the Owner's sole risk so long as Declarant has not
yet begun or is engaged in the construction of a Home on an adjacent Lot. In
the event such construction activity on an adjacent Lot causes damage to or
destruction of such Owner's fence or landscape materials or any part thereof,
the Owner on whose Lot the fence and/or landscaping has been damaged
shall be required, at the Owner's expense, to repair or replace such fence
and/or landscape materials in conformance with the requirements of the
Committee's approval of the initial installation of the fence and/or landscape
materials and Declarant shall have no liability for any such damage or
destruction. Such repair or replacement shall commence as soon as
construction on the adjacent Lot has been completed and shall be pursued to
completion with due diligence. For purposes of this paragraph, the term
"landscape materials" shall include landscape materials located on or
adjacent to any property line of a Lot, including, by way of example and not
of limitation, hedges, shrubs and trees, whether associated with a fence or
not.
In addition, the installation of any fence placed upon any Lot is
subject to easements which run with the land. In the event that any fence is
approved by the Committee and is permitted to cross any such easements,
such Committee's approval is still subject to Owner first receiving written
approval from the grantee of such easements and all other applicable
governmental authorities. In the event the grantee of any such easement
which runs with the land (i.e ., utility provider or the County), its successors

and/or assigns, requires the removal of any fence upon the Lot, then the
Owner of said Lot shall, at the Owner's sole cost and expense, immediately
remove the fence. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any permit or
governmental approval to the contrary, no fence may be installed within any
drainage easement(s) by any Owner, other than Declarant, without the
Committee's approval, or Lake maintenance easement on the Property. The
Owner of a Lot, when installing any fence upon the Lot, shall comply with all
valid laws, zoning ordinances, codes, rules and regulations of all applicable
governmental bodies, as applicable, in addition to the Committee approval
required by Article VIII hereof.
Invisible fencing may be allowed if approved by the Committee. Any
Owner permitted to install any invisible fencing acknowledges that the
Association and the landscape maintenance company hired by the
Association shall not be responsible for any damage caused to such invisible
fencing by the Association's landscape maintenance company. Each Owner
who is permitted to install invisible fencing on such Owner's Lot will be
required to sign an acknowledgment that such Owner shall be responsible for
any repairs and/or replacement of the invisible fencing, even if such repair
and/or replacement was caused by the Association's landscape maintenance
company in performing their responsibilities of landscape maintenance.

es. A strong community image is critical to the enhancement of long term value. All landscape areas on the lot shall be
planted with trees, shrubs, ground covers and turf, common or native to the region and designed to complement the
architectural character of the house in form, location and scale.
Mulch Standard is Cocoa Brown mulch Mulching promotes sustainable landscaping by helping to keep plant roots
moist, shaded and free of weeds. All mulch installed will be from regenerative resources and match the mulch selected
for the community. Rock and any other type of inorganic material is prohibited for use in any bed that is adjacent to
turf.
All modifications that require individual landscape plans must meet the following criteria:
They must be clearly and easily read.
..
Existing easements must be shown on the plan, along with existing trees over five inches (5") in caliper, measured
three feet (3') from the ground. All rights-of-way and utilities must be shown on the plan.
Landscape plant materials are to be identified as to quantity, quality, specific size to be planted and common bo-
tanical name with variety.
All hard surface materials are to be clearly noted as to their type and composition.
.
. .
All modifications to irrigation must be either noted on plan or fully described in writing.
All plans shall conform to the County standards. Please refer to the appropriate County publications for landscape
design and street tree requirements by lot size

whenever certain plants become overly problematic to maintain, given specific site conditions.
PLANT MATERIALS
Permitted and Prohibited Species
All plant material used should be selected from the community specific plant list included in these guidelines. Plant
species that are not listed may only be used with the consent of the ARC on a case by case basis and their approval pro-
vides no guarantees that the plants selected will perform well.
Owner Risk
For consistency in the landscape design, all plant materials shall be selected from the approved Plant List, unless other-
wise determined by the ARC. Some plant materials are prohibited because of undesirable qualities or are considered to
be an invasive species. These plant materials are also listed. Sizes described in the Planting Palette as designed are
minimum sizes. In making changes to the initial landscape, the homeowner assumes all risk for the establishment of
the new plants and for any ongoing replacement needed due improper planting technique, excessive mulch, sensitivity
to temperature, moisture and sunlight and any increased pest susceptibilities that the plants may exhibit. All applica-
tions will require an Exhibit with that identifies the following:
.
Plant species
.
Minimum size, condition and quality
All non- shrub areas must be completely sodded.
All trees and shrubs will be Florida No. 1 as defined in "Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants", Part I and II,
